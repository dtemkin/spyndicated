{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/irgXK6ziw54", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-14 10:11:00", "summary": " on monday, amazon  reportedly  began a series of rare layoffs at its headquarters in seattle, cutting several hundred corporate employees. but this week, something quite different is happening at the company\u2019s warehouses and customer-service centers across the country: amazon will politely ask its \u201cassociates\u201d\u2014full-time and part-time hourly employees\u2014if they\u2019d prefer to quit. and if they do, amazon will pay them as much as $5,000 for walking out the door.  officially called \u201cthe offer,\u201d this proposition is, according to amazon, a way to encourage unhappy employees to move on. \u201cwe believe staying somewhere you don\u2019t want to be isn\u2019t healthy for our employees or for the company,\u201d ashley robinson, an amazon spokesperson, wrote to me in an email. the amount full-time employees get offered ranges from $2,000 to $5,000, and depends on how long they have been at the company; if they take the money, they agree to never work for amazon again. (the idea for all this  originated  at zappos, the online shoe retailer that amazon bought in 2009.)  considering that amazon  reportedly  already has high turnover\u2014it is a famously efficient company that asks a lot of its workers\u2014it may seem surprising that it would incentivize workers to walk away. many employees at amazon\u2019s warehouses,  as i\u2019ve written before , say that they are constantly pressured to work harder and faster (and get fired if they don\u2019t), and that the jobs are physically and psychologically grueling.  when i asked amazon about these workers\u2019 complaints, the company said that the top priority of its fulfillment centers is the success and well-being of its employees. no worker is ever dismissed without good reason, robinson told me. and as the company grows, she added, it is \u201cstrongly in our interests\u201d to retain existing employees. but that just makes the offer seem more puzzling. if amazon wants to retain employees, why would it pay them to leave?  with the offer, amazon seems to be making the calculation that weeding out a single unengaged worker is worth as much as multiple thousands of dollars. but there might be other, less obvious effects of providing the offer that serve to benefit amazon, according to some behavioral economists. the offer might in fact be a way to make employees stay longer than they otherwise might.  the reasoning goes like this: employees resist an initial temptation\u2014to quit amazon and walk out with cash\u2014and by resisting it, they may actually feel more committed to their jobs, said ian ayres, a professor at yale law school who wrote about the concept of the offer in his book  carrots and sticks: unlock the power of incentives to get things done . amazon employees who evaluate the offer and then turn it down have decided they like the company enough to stay a little longer. they then want their future behavior to match that feeling, ayres said.  when i talked to katherine milkman, a professor at the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania, she brought up a similar idea, from the realm of social psychology. she talked about the mental pressure humans feel to resolve cognitive dissonance\u2014if people have two conflicting beliefs, they\u2019ll try to rationalize one to make it fit with the other. in this case, workers may dislike their jobs at amazon, but if they turn down the offer, it means they passed on a chance to quit. it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll then try to convince themselves that they actually like working at amazon, milkman said. to pick a more extreme example of this phenomenon, when people join a cult that says the world is going to end on a certain date and then it doesnt end,   they tend to  end up believing more strongly in the cult , because they can\u2019t put up with the cognitive dissonance between what they believe and what actually happened.  milkman also brought up \u201cescalation of commitment,\u201d another concept studied by behavioral economists. the idea is that when people put a lot of money or effort into something and it appears to be going badly\u2014perhaps they bought a stock and the share price is tanking\u2014they often double down on their commitment. \u201cthey say, \u2018i want to see this turn around\u2014i don\u2019t want it to turn out badly,\u2019\u201d milkman said. when employees see that they\u2019ve lost $5,000 by not taking the offer, they might mentally recommit to the company, trying to do better at their jobs and enjoy them more.  amazon is just one of dozens of companies (many of them tech firms) that are looking for ways to use behavioral-economics findings to try to make their companies run more efficiently, and, in some cases, make their employees happier and healthier. google, for instance, has conducted a  number of experiments  in its cafeterias to nudge employees toward eating vegetables or cutting down on the number of m&m\u2019s they consume. (maya shankar, who had founded the social and behavioral sciences team in the obama white house, now runs a behavioral-science division at google.) uber  uses digital nudges in its app  to try and motivate its drivers to pick up more fares and work longer hours. \u201ci think companies are recognizing that there\u2019s a lot to be learned from research about how to build smart incentive systems and use behavioral science to design tools that aren\u2019t just cash,\u201d said milkman.  an important caveat about the offer is that\u2014regardless of how it may register in an employee\u2019s mind\u2014the people who do take it don\u2019t actually walk away with $5,000. a big chunk of the payment is taxed, and employees who might have received benefits (in the form of 401(k) contributions or shares of stock) if they stayed to a certain date might not be around long enough for those benefits to vest. john burgett, a current amazon employee who has worked various positions in a warehouse in indiana since 2014 and blogs about his experiences at  amazon emancipatory , estimated that if he took the offer in early 2017, he would have received a $3,000 payout. but he says he also would have lost a portion of his 401(k), which would not vest until he had been with the company for three continuous years, and also would have lost four shares of amazon stock that would not vest until the summer of 2017. he also figured the company can pay a new employee less than it pays him, since he has received a few raises over the years. (at the time of his calculations, he made $13 an hour.) \u201ci\u2019ve considered it, but i\u2019ve always said it\u2019s a bad deal,\u201d he told me.  behavioral economics aside, part of amazon\u2019s reasoning for issuing the offer is probably straightforward: it wants to prod unhappy employees to leave. and each year, some people\u2014\u201ca small percentage,\u201d according to amazon\u2014do take the company up on it. they include jim perota, who is now 60, and worked for amazon\u2019s distribution center in chattanooga for three years. he says he hated the job. he says he lost 30 pounds working at amazon because he was on his feet so much, picking items off shelves and putting them in bins, and also packing goods into boxes. his breaks were only 15 minutes, but it would take 10 minutes to get to the break room, so he\u2019d sit on stairs, waiting for the work to begin again, he told me. perota had worked for the postal service, as a disc jockey, and for the u.s. census, but working for amazon \u201cwas the most brutal, and it took the biggest toll on my body,\u201d he said. but he couldn\u2019t quit, because he needed the health insurance, he said.  but then obamacare came to tennessee. in 2014, amazon presented the offer to employees at perota\u2019s warehouse on a tuesday in march. on thursday of that week, perota signed up for obamacare. on friday, he took the offer and quit his job. it was one of the best decisions he ever made, he said. \u201ci felt pretty liberated when i walked out those doors for the last time,\u201d he said. he now works as a nighttime security guard.  in the end, the offer wasn\u2019t a financial boon for perota. he received $3,000 from the company, but says he more or less broke even because the money was taxed heavily, and he lost the employer contributions in his 401(k), because he had not been with the company long enough to walk away with it. but that didn\u2019t matter, he told me. what mattered was that he got out.

(meagan flynn / the atlantic)   houston has developed other vertical-farm concepts in the past two years. there\u2019s space city farms, a backyard aeroponic vertical garden; dream harvest, a hydroponic system similar to moonflower; and acre in a box, a literal take on the operation housed in a shipping container.  acre in a box\u2019s founders\u2014andrew abendshein, who works for an oil and gas trading firm in houston, and ana buckman, a rice university languages and creative-writing instructor\u2014had no background in agriculture when they invested $80,000 in their first shipping-container farm. abendshein said he has long had an interest in getting fresh produce to urban food deserts and hopes to one day start moving shipping-container vertical farms into those neighborhoods. for now, though, acre in a box\u2019s two farms are hidden in the parking lot of an abandoned drill-bit factory at the end of a dead-end street in houston\u2019s east downtown, a few blocks from where houston\u2019s two largest bayous intersect.    harvey, and the deluge it brought, are exactly the kind of scenario that vertical farms are designed to withstand. catastrophic flooding events like harvey are only expected to become  more frequent , and threats of food and water scarcity are projected to worsen in the years to come\u2014all as the population grows. the united nations  projects that the world\u2019s population will be 9.8 billion by 2050 , with  roughly two-thirds of those people living in urban areas , which aren\u2019t exactly conducive to large-scale farming.  to meet the growing demand for food, the un\u2019s food and agriculture organization estimates that there needs to be a  50 percent increase  in global agriculture production\u2014a distinct challenge, the un warns, in the face of climate change and the growing need for water conservation. vertical farms present a potential solution: there is no fertilizer runoff into the groundwater, fewer co2 emissions from delivery trucks\u2019 long journeys, and no land to till. they require only a fraction of the acreage and use only a fraction of the water\u2014anywhere from  90  to  97 percent  less\u2014that traditional farms do.  \u201cwe are kind of at the beginning of a revolution,\u201d per pinstrup-andersen, a graduate-school professor at cornell university\u2019s college of human ecology, told me. \u201cwe\u2019re at the beginning of a very rapid development in the use of indoor controlled facilities for producing vegetables and some fruits,\u201d he said. \u201cno matter what happens with climate change, you still have your controlled environment.\u201d  the technology used for these farms has been around for decades. in fact, marques began studying it in the 1990s after learning that nasa used it to grow plants in space. but only in the last several years has interest in using the technology for urban, commercial-scale agriculture picked up. indoor farms have recently sprouted up in old warehouses, shipping containers, and small skyscrapers in new jersey, south korea, germany, india, and dubai\u2014places where traditional farming is either difficult or impossible due to climate, population density, or the land itself. in houston, sprawling commercial and residential developments were built on top of a swamp, making large-scale outdoor farming virtually impossible.  marques and i hopped in his minivan and headed about a mile away from his garden to the site of the moonflower farms expansion, where men in hard hats were surveying the land. the new facility doesn\u2019t look like much yet\u2014just a large elevated mound of dirt with metal poles sticking out of it. but by the time it\u2019s operational, marques plans to have a 20,000-square-foot greenhouse that he expects will churn out 1,000 pounds of produce per day\u2014compared with the 20 pounds that his tiny facility produces now. he currently sells to a couple dozen restaurants but plans to expand to regional and national distributors and local grocers once the new facility is up and running.  the elimination of long, cross-country transports to get the produce to grocery stores means consumers wind up with fresher food. right now, marques said, the time from harvest to table is sometimes only a matter of hours, which means that produce arrives in better shape and then lasts longer both in the store and in people\u2019s homes. \u201cif we can make this work in the city of houston and produce 1,000 pounds a day or more of product\u2014high-quality product that has three times the shelf life\u2014then we have a good model that we can pretty much [take] to any city in the world and replicate,\u201d marques said.  the new greenhouse will operate like a research-and-development facility, helping marques perfect a prototype that interested farmers around the world can use as a template. he already knows that he\u2019ll need to make some changes. for starters, he\u2019s not going to rely exclusively on led lighting as he does now; instead he will mostly use sunlight, plugging in energy-efficient lighting as a supplement\u2014a measure that will cut costs significantly. marques said he has already had inquiries about this model from a food distributor in cairo, where  the arid climate and heavy reliance on imported crops  make the food supply  unpredictable . marques says he has also talked to strawberry growers in norway, where thousands of metric tons of strawberries  are imported  every year due to the short growing season. and he has heard from cattle farmers in brazil, where  the shrinking availability of pastureland  and  prohibitions on razing rainforests  mean that some farmers may need to import grass to feed their cows.    ana buckman, acre in a box\u2019s cfo, shows off kale that was later sent off to local businesses in houston. (meagan flynn / the atlantic)   cutting the costs of building and maintaining the systems themselves will be crucial as vertical farms continue to evolve, according to henry gordon-smith, the co-founder of the international association for vertical farming and a consultant at the new york\u2013based firm agritecture. as a result of high costs, gordon-smith said, several vertical farms in north america have failed in recent years. that\u2019s what happened at localgarden, a rooftop vertical farm in vancouver that went bankrupt in 2014, and at podponics, a shipping-container vertical farm in atlanta, where high labor and technology costs were consistently undermining return on investment.  mike nasseri, who was the harvest supervisor at localgarden, said that design flaws had inflated the endeavor\u2019s operational and energy costs to the point that the farm couldn\u2019t make enough money. even though the farm had started small, nasseri said the crew decided to scale up too quickly to a commercial operation. to make matters worse, nasseri said, the costs of the real estate in the middle of downtown vancouver\u2014a central location he said he would not recommend for new vertical farmers \u2014were way too high. \u201cthat placement [in the middle of downtown] is basically the first way you can screw up,\u201d nasseri said.  still, he\u2019s a major proponent of vertical farming, primarily because of its environmental benefits. he\u2019s now working at a startup called ava technologies, developing indoor \u201csmart gardens,\u201d essentially mini vertical farms that can fit on kitchen counters.  gordon-smith said the industry-wide goal going forward has to be to minimize the risk of failure, financial or otherwise, as much as possible in order to make vertical farming more accessible to the younger generation of produce growers, who have been  moving steadily away   from rural areas  and toward cities over the past few decades. still, he said, the failures serve as lessons for new investors as they continue to develop various types of vertical farms.  like marques, abendshein, the founder of acre in a box, was stuck at home monitoring his produce from the couch during harvey. but he knew he could rest assured that, as the waters raged, his produce was safe. without land that could be ruined for an entire season, the worst that could happen, he thought, was that his farms would float away.

the stock market is a synthesis of stories about the future, a global anthology of investors\u2019 financial predictions. when stocks rise steadily with little volatility\u2014as they have for the last few years\u2014it suggests widespread agreement on the world\u2019s economic narrative. for a long time, the story went that corporate profits were rising in global unison for the first time in years, as both inflation and interest rates stayed low, creating a relatively risk-free environment for equities.  then, rather suddenly, the story changed. on friday of last week, the bureau of labor statistics announced that wages had grown by 2.9 percent over the previous 12 months, a record high for the current expansion. this seems to have triggered fears that higher wages chasing a finite number of goods and services would lead to higher prices and furthermore that higher prices would encourage the federal reserve to raise interest rates to combat inflation.  just as low interest rates had buoyed stock prices for years, the fear of rising interest rates has the opposite effect, inspiring a \u201cflight to safety\u201d as traders switch from stocks to fixed-income investments, such as government bonds. as investors scrambled to move money from equities to bonds, many traders who had bet against this sort of volatility\u2014through a ( now controversial ) financial instrument, called xiv, that essentially allowed people to place wagers on continued calmness in the markets\u2014were nearly wiped out. it all led to the worst nominal loss in the history of the dow.  and that was just monday. on tuesday and wednesday, stocks whirled like a plastic bag in a hurricane, at one point recovering most of their losses. then, on thursday, everything fell apart all over again in the midst of a crowded news cycle, as china\u2019s trade surplus  narrowed , and republicans announced their plan to pass a deficit-swelling budget.  the significance of this week\u2019s market gyrations can be stated simply: there is no reason to believe that this is the beginning a global financial crisis. nor is there reason to believe this is the foreshadowing of a u.s. recession. assigning monocausal blame for soaring or plunging stocks is a rough business, but what happened this week is in all likelihood a tizzy over inflation.  but if markets are afraid of inflation, they are fearing a ghost. ever since the 2008 financial crisis, warnings of incipient inflation have been  both persistent and wrong . the federal reserve has routinely aimed for 2 percent inflation in the years following the housing crash, and its aim has been routinely low. in 2016 and 2017, wage growth accelerated for lower-income americans. but annual growth in \u201ccore personal-consumption expenditures\u201d\u2014the fed\u2019s most commonly used inflation measure\u2014was  1.7 and 1.5 percent  in those years. wages perked up a bit. prices didn\u2019t.  if investors are afraid of the fed\u2019s approach to inflation, it is ironic that this season\u2019s research note from the federal reserve bank of st. louis is titled \u201c why is inflation so low? \u201d \u201cthe u.s. inflation rate has been below the fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation target since 2012,\u201d the paper begins, going on to cite \u201cseveral reasons to be concerned about very low inflation,\u201d such as the risk of a recession caused by falling prices, or deflation. this isn\u2019t a purely american phenomenon, either. the world has been trapped for years in a steady state of low price growth. in 2017, annual inflation across the rich countries that make up the organization for economic cooperation and development was  j  ust 1.7 percent .  is this story about to change? nobody knows. but one data point of 2.9 percent wage growth is just that: one point of data. it\u2019s  not proof  that wages are taking off. it\u2019s certainly not proof that accelerating wage growth is driving up prices. for now, it\u2019s just a statistic, yet it seems to have helped trigger a frenzy of fear across global markets that inflation\u2014that ever-feared and never-appeared boogeyman\u2014will finally materialize.  for years, stock prices have inflated in part due to constraints on labor costs. now at the slightest sign that labor costs might themselves be inflating, equities seem to be crashing for fear the central banks might rein in their support of economic growth. that\u2019s quite a shame. if investors are wary of central bankers because they think bankers are wary of labor\u2019s gains, it sets up a dynamic where capital specifically defines risk-free success by its capacity to restrain the prospects of labor. capitalism may be the best flawed economic system out there, but is it any wonder that  more americans are starting to doubt that it\u2019s working ?

advertising. indeed, amazon\u2019s ad business\u2014which includes  sponsored ads on alexa , suggested items on amazon search pages, and even ad boxes around the internet on other sites \u2014  grew 60 percent last quarter , faster than google\u2019s or facebook\u2019s, albeit from a lower base. the business is on track to make as much as $10 billion in revenue by the end of this year, or about one-quarter of facebook\u2019s total revenue in 2017. as amazon draws more consumers into its orbit, it will also pull competitors into a deflationary cycle: each time the company enters a new industry,  like those for grocery stores or pharmacies , the stock valuations of the sector\u2019s largest companies decline, as investors anticipate that amazon will pull down the industry\u2019s profits to zero in order to draw in consumers and maximize cash flow.  amazon was a fascinating buyer for whole foods for just this reason. it is the anti\u2013whole foods, forever evincing a no-frills obsession with low prices and absolute convenience over artisanal touches. and yet, the two companies are perfect partners. whole foods became a kind of cult for its most devoted customers, who sacrificed their weekly food budget on the altar of artisanal produce. jeff bezos\u2019s ultimate ambition is similarly cultish: to build a pan-commercial enterprise, where every consumer question is best answered by first asking amazon. the company is a leveraged bet on  absolute customer convenience . and nothing says \u201cabsolute customer convenience\u201d like yelling the word  kale!  at a box in one\u2019s living room and finding fresh greens on one\u2019s doorstep within 120 minutes.

bad news, markets down. in reality, though, financial markets have an obtuse, metaphysical relationship with economic data: good news, who knows; bad news, who knows. \u00a0\u00a0  as a very general point, the markets do tend to drift in  the same direction  as the economy. recessions tend to come with declines in the standard & poor\u2019s 500 (a  far better index  to keep an eye on than the dow jones, by the way). expansions tend to come with bull markets. but the financial markets tend to be vastly more volatile than headline economic figures\u2014and that is true even in the long period of unusually  low volatility  that appeared to end late last week. an economy growing 2 percent a year might see market surges of 2 percent a day, or swift year-on-year growth of 10 percent.  plus, on a day-to-day level, good economic news does not cleanly translate into a higher market, nor does bad news translate into a worse one. financial traders take in a huge number of economic and financial variables. they bet on what the other guy knows. they signal. they hedge. they construct algorithms to seek out strange correlations. as such, in the short term, it tends to be surprising news\u2014not good or bad news\u2014that forces market movements. and sometimes it is no news at all.  indeed, it is often totally unclear what causes a given surge or sell-off. trump was trumpeting the theory that better-than-expected jobs and wage numbers raised concerns about rising inflation and tighter monetary policy. \u201cthe u.s. federal reserve is raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating,\u201d ken griffin, the founder of the investment behemoth citadel, wrote in a note late last week, just as the market started to sour. \u201cwe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs of accelerating inflation in many countries around the world, given the general complacency around the risks of an inflationary shock.\u201d but nobody knows for sure. perhaps the gyrations have to do with  interest rates . perhaps they have to do with rising wages cutting into  corporate profits . perhaps they have to do with  algorithmic trading . perhaps traders  are trolling  the new federal reserve chairman.  the important thing\u2014and the reason it seems that most americans can safely ignore the turbulence\u2014is that the economic and business outlook remains rosy. global growth is secure for now; the federal reserve has telegraphed its intention to increase interest rates; businesses are competing for workers. \u201cit seems like people are pricing in that the tax cut is going to have more of a near-term stimulative effect then maybe we appreciated a few months ago,\u201d neel kashkari, the president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis, said in a  television interview  this week.  further, it would take a much more significant sell-off to mar the extraordinary bull run that has gone on for nearly a decade at this point. after the setbacks of the past few days, the dow jones is back where it was in december\u2014which is still far higher than it was when president trump took office, let alone when president barack obama took office. anyone with an investment horizon longer than a few weeks is likely to be firmly in the black, and anyone with an investment horizon longer than a few days would probably do well to ignore the headlines and flashing lights.  that goes for president trump, too. presidents have historically tried  to avoid  talking about these volatile investments, given that what goes up so often goes down, and given that what is good for traders and investors is not always good for workers. but this president touted that the market has \u201csmashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value\u201d in his state of the union address, and argued that \u201cthe reason our stock market is so successful is because of me\u201d a few months ago. that, to be clear, is not true either.

it\u2019s certainly not a case of fewer advertisements. the typical american has gone from seeing about 500 ads each day in the 1970s to about 5,000 today,  according to a   common industry statistic  (and some  more-recent estimates  are much higher). that is one corporate message for roughly every 10 seconds of waking life.  instead, the mysterious decline can be explained by two developments, most prominently technology\u2019s invasion of the ad sector and the phenomenon of more corporations trying to emulate outside media companies in-house, which leaves less work for traditional ad firms.  first, there are facebook and google. they are the largest advertising companies in the world\u2014and, quite likely, the largest in the history of the world. last year, 90 percent of the growth of the digital-advertising business went to just these two firms. facebook and google are so profitable because they use their enormous scale and data to deliver targeted advertising at a low cost. this has forced the world\u2019s large advertising firms to preserve their profitability through  a series of mergers , accompanied by jobs cuts in the name of efficiency.  so what has been the effect of these tech companies on advertising employment? the bureau of labor statistics technically considers facebook and google to be  \u201cdata processing\u201d  companies, rather than advertising companies. so, because of this label, what government records show is not that facebook and google have stopped hiring people in their advertising divisions, but rather that the growth of those divisions has caused the traditional advertising market to shrink.  the emergence of an advertising duopoly has coincided with the rise of \u201cprogrammatic advertising,\u201d a torpid term that essentially means \u201ccompanies using algorithms to buy and place ads in those little boxes all over the internet.\u201d as any  mad men  fan might intuit, advertising has long been a relationship-driven business, in which multimillion-dollar contracts are hammered out over one-on-one meetings, countless lunches, and even more-countless drinks. with programmatic technology, however, companies can buy access to specific audiences across several publishing platforms at once, bypassing the work of building relationships with each one. that process produces more ads and requires fewer people\u2014or, at least, fewer traditional advertising jobs and more technical jobs.  the old story about programmatic advertising was that both marketers and digital publishers\u2014think aol, or any news site\u2014embraced the technology, as it allowed companies to cheaply target specific audiences on a budget. but the new reality is that programmatic advertising has placed many advertisements in controversial places, next to low-quality news sources or outright offensive content. between 2016 and 2017, a survey by the association of national advertisers found that  a third of marketers cut back on media agencies  running programmatic ad campaigns. instead, brands brought those operations in-house, where they have more control over where their ads run and much more information about who actually sees them. the upshot: programmatic ads have been a double blow to media agencies, first automating their function and then encouraging companies to insource the work.  second, there is the merging of the advertising and entertainment businesses. as smartphone screens have edged out tv as the most important real estate for media, companies have invested more in \u201cbranded content\u201d\u2014corporate-sponsored media, such as an article or video, that resembles traditional entertainment more than it does traditional advertising. some of the most prominent names in journalism, such as  the   new york times ,  buzzfeed ,  vice , and  the atlantic , are owned by companies that have launched their own branded-content shops, which operate as stand-alone divisions. as many media companies have tried to become more like advertising companies, the value of the average \u201ccreative-account win,\u201d an ad-industry term for a new contract, has declined,  falling by about 40 percent  between 2016 and 2017.  so there are two major themes of the decline of advertising jobs, one that has to do with the companies that now create them and one that has to do with the way brands prefer to market themselves nowadays. in short, the future of the advertising business is being moved to technology companies managing ad networks and media companies making branded content\u2014that is, away from the ad agencies.

(when these moments are especially dramatic\u2014when a major index loses 10 percent or more of its value\u2014analysts call them \u201ccorrections.\u201d) historically, that type of uninterrupted growth isn\u2019t normal. in fact, the lack of market dips is what led some,  including donald trump at one time , to worry that perhaps a bubble was forming, and that stocks were artificially inflated.  most analysts agree that there\u2019s little evidence that a sizable bubble exists\u2014that the markets have been on a tear because the economy has slowly and steadily been strengthening since the end of the great recession. since then, an improving labor market, higher corporate profits, and interest rates kept low by the fed have meant boom times for big businesses and the investors who poured their money into the markets. now, some of that may be changing, even if the fundamentals of the economy aren\u2019t.  there have been plenty of theories about why the market has sunk, even though it\u2019s considered difficult (if not impossible) to point to any single explanation. one of the more outlandish ideas is that the market is \u201ctesting\u201d the fed\u2019s new leader, jerome powell, but that\u2019s more conspiracy theory than reality. others suggest that recent political and economic shifts might be behind the losses. the january jobs report showed that average hourly earnings grew 2.9 percent over the past year\u2014the most significant growth since 2009. while that\u2019s great news for most americans, it could mean tighter profit margins for corporations. further, a strengthening economy could mean that the federal reserve chooses to raise rates more drastically than it has in the past\u2014which would making securing credit and borrowing more expensive than they have been in years. as investors and business owners consider those potential changes, they could start making new calculations about where to put their money.  even as the markets continue to fluctuate wildly, and volatility persists, it\u2019s important to remember that the economy has lately been full of good news. wages are growing, corporations are more profitable than ever, unemployment is low. while the most recent downturn might be unsettling, it\u2019s actually pretty normal.

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/F0mQCwZr4DA", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-05 13:00:00", "summary": "  in march 2017 , the new york city\u2013based editors and writers of  the atlantic  moved to a wework office in brooklyn. i remember our first morning vividly: it was like entering the millennial id. craft beer and cucumber water poured from kitchen taps. laptoppers in jeans and toques clacked along to mgmt in the wood-paneled common area. a wework \u201ccommunity manager\u201d showed us to a glass-walled office so small that my colleagues and i could clasp hands while seated. we sat. had we arrived in the future of work?     the atlantic  told us this arrangement would be temporary while our real office was renovated. as of this writing, we\u2019re still here. if wework had its way, we\u2019d stay forever, along with much of the 21st-century workforce.  wework is the world\u2019s leading co-working company and the sixth-most-valuable start-up, according to venturesource. last year it was valued at $20 billion, a staggering sum for a company renting out short-term office space, mostly to small businesses and freelancers. but like uber and airbnb, wework positions itself grandly, as a disruptive revolutionary. it promises to \u201chumanize\u201d work, making the office a more creative place, with the right lighting, the right snacks, and, crucially, the right people.  wework would say it\u2019s well on its way to transforming white-collar labor: it seats 175,000 \u201cmembers\u201d in 207 locations across 20 countries, with plans to double in size this year. its leaders describe it not as a real-estate venture but as a \u201ccommunity company.\u201d  whether that\u2019s a $20 billion business, however, is a matter of contention. companies specializing in shared office space have come before. as  the   wall street journal  noted this fall, the office-leasing company iwg manages five times the square footage but has about one-eighth the market value. even adam neumann, a co-founder of wework and its ceo, admits that his company is overvalued, if you\u2019re looking merely at desks leased or rents collected. \u201cno one is investing in a co-working company worth $20 billion. that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he told  forbes  in 2017. \u201cour valuation and size today are much more based on our energy and spirituality than it is on a multiple of revenue.\u201d  that\u2019s a striking statement. shuffleboard tables and free ipas, however enticing, surely can\u2019t justify the recent $4.4 billion round of venture capital propelling the company\u2019s growth. but these cramped quarters may hold more than meets the eye. wework\u2019s real value might indeed be in the elbow-to-elbow \u201cenergy\u201d neumann describes\u2014just not for the community you might imagine.  t he office sublet  is not an innovation of the digital age. but the idea of a co-working space\u2014a collection of like-minded renters committed to forming a community\u2014 is  a more recent development. its history might begin with the european hacker spaces of the 1990s, where independent programmers swapped coding skills in dark basements with an air of techno-anarchism. americans caught on a few years later. the first true co-working space, so-called, emerged in 2005, renting square footage from a feminist collective in san francisco\u2019s mission district. this eventually became the hat factory, an industrial loft in the dogpatch neighborhood, which described itself as a \u201ccommunity office space for geeks and media hackers.\u201d it was co-founded by the guy who invented the hashtag.  the first wave of co-working served a relatively small, scrappy set of independent contractors and do-gooders. the second wave has responded to an economy in which independent work has become more default than choice. the 2008 financial crash forced employers to cut hours and jobs, and the emerging gig economy swelled the ranks of the self-employed. thus wework\u2019s eclectic mix of freelance writers, labor organizers, financial consultants, and app developers hustling for investors.  adam neumann was himself a struggling entrepreneur (he owned a company that sold baby clothes) in recession-era new york when he and a couple of friends rented out space in a brooklyn building to make some additional income. demand proved stronger than expected. in 2010, neumann, who was raised in part on a kibbutz in israel, and miguel mckelvey, who grew up with five mothers in an oregon collective and studied architecture in college, leased a few thousand square feet in soho and opened the first wework: a shared space where enterprising creatives could work and play.  from the start, wework offered a somewhat uneasy combination of its founders\u2019 ambitions and co-working\u2019s communal roots. neumann describes wework as a \u201ccapitalist kibbutz.\u201d members are encouraged to mingle, network, and leverage one another\u2019s talents, frequently under the auspices of a corporate sponsor: witness taco pop-ups promoting internet phone service; talk-therapy circles sponsored by a women\u2019s activewear brand; cocktails served up by the payroll-software giant adp. billed as community-building programming, the events can feel more like exercises in targeted advertising, with members as the marks. genuine connections do occur\u2014sometimes at happy hours and often through wework\u2019s online member network, where people share marketing tips, sell furniture, organize cryptocurrency seminars. (the variety of requests never ceases to amaze. quickly fulfilled: \u201cany wework salted cured meat companies?\u201d apparently unfulfilled: \u201ccan anyone refer me to a good venture capitalist in the nyc area?\u201d)  despite the company\u2019s occasional excesses, wework offices  are  more pleasant than many a soulless cubicle farm, according to people i spoke with at locations in new york; washington, d.c.; boston; and los angeles. \u201cpeople are relaxed. no one\u2019s watching the clock,\u201d says liz granda, who works for brooklyn paws, a concierge service for pet owners, in a wework under the manhattan bridge. the relentlessly cheerful vibe encourages members to be social, or at least forces them to be nice. nicole shore, the principal of zero to sixty communications, a boutique pr firm, has rented desks in locations around the country. she told me she got to know her go-to graphic designer at a wework christmas party. at its best, with its abundant conveniences and event-directing community managers, wework can feel like an all-inclusive cruise.  cruises, of course, aren\u2019t for everyone. many observers in the real-estate industry say wework is wildly overvalued, and its aggressive expansion plans unrealistic. although it has reportedly begun raising money for a real-estate-investment fund, the company owns few physical assets. its practice has been to sign long-term leases en masse, striking multiproperty agreements to get the best deals with landlords, then renting spaces at a premium. (many members told me that, per square foot, wework is considerably pricier than a traditional rental, but that they\u2019re willing to pay extra for the turnkey flexibility and sense of community.) it\u2019s a classic lease-arbitrage model, which business-school professors will tell you carries significant risk: whenever the next economic downturn hits, demand for office space may retreat, leaving wework with a lot of empty desks and multiyear leases to pay.  investors have seen this movie before. iwg, itself a network of flexible office spaces, expanded rapidly in the 1990s (it was known as regus at the time) on a wave of high-hope investment, only to seek bankruptcy protection after the dot-com bust. what distinguishes the younger player, really, besides charismatic leadership and lofty rhetoric? \u201cwework is nothing but regus with a paint job,\u201d one industry veteran told  the wall street   journal . many investors have placed their bets because they\u2019re dazzled by neumann, konrad putzier, a real-estate reporter at  the real deal , told me.  w ework may be positioning itself  more strategically than some of its detractors allow. more and more of the people inside the glass-walled grids are not entrepreneurs or gig workers. they\u2019re employees of facebook, amazon, general electric, ibm, bank of america, and hundreds of other large corporations. blue-chip companies are the fastest-growing segment of wework\u2019s client base. their employees now represent more than 25 percent of wework members.  at wework, companies with more than 1,000 employees globally are known as \u201centerprise\u201d members. veresh sita, an executive who oversees products for this group, told me that many enterprise members first looked to wework for temporary overflow space or as an outpost in a new market. now wework is actively courting them. \u201cour concept is \u2018come for a month, stay for life,\u2019\u2009\u201d sita said.  the benefit that big companies offer wework seems clear: salesforce, hsbc, and facebook are presumably more reliable subtenants than a fluctuating mix of long-shot start-ups and quixotic nonprofits. what do corporations get in the deal? wework estimates that enterprise members save 25 to 50 percent in operating expenses, compared with traditional office build-outs. but members told me it\u2019s less the cost, and more the convenience and cool factor, that draws them in. big, buttoned-up companies aren\u2019t always good at providing the kinds of perks and services many workers have come to expect. \u201cwe\u2019ve become a talent feeder for the rest of the company,\u201d says adam l\u2019italien, the vice president of global consumer markets innovation at liberty mutual insurance, which leases space at a boston wework. \u201cwe\u2019re able to show people we do things that are less obvious when you think about liberty and insurance products.\u201d  wework offers more than just a chiller vibe. in a 2016 trial run, microsoft gave 300 salespeople in three u.s. cities access to wework spaces as an alternative to their existing offices in those cities. after a few months, more than 80 percent of the workers reported that the access made them more productive throughout their day.  wework is selling enterprise members on the idea that it can make their workers more productive still. sita told me that wework plans to sprinkle offices with data-harvesting sensors and facial-recognition software as part of its \u201cpowered by we\u201d suite of services. the program will allow wework to monitor how employees use its spaces: how they adjust their desks, where in the office they spend their time, and maybe even how engaged they are in meetings. these data\u2014which, according to wework, would never be used to track the movements of individual employees\u2014could allow companies to lease exactly the right amount of space, and exactly the right  kind  of space, too. phil kirschner, the director of workplace strategy, describes a future in which someone could check into any wework in the world and sit at a desk that automatically adjusted to the right height.  until that creepy, if ergonomically correct, future comes to pass, the benefits that wework confers on enterprise members may come from a tried-and-true real-estate verity: it\u2019s all about location. microsoft employees noted that wework\u2019s scatter plot of primo sites gave them more-convenient access to clients. other enterprise members have benefited from new neighbors within wework\u2019s walls. the accounting giant kpmg has a 50-desk space in a manhattan wework. leaders say one of the greatest advantages has been access to the entrepreneurial talent of wework members. david pessah, the director of kpmg\u2019s innovation labs, previously worked at a snapchat-esque start-up in the same wework. repeated run-ins and informal chats with his now-boss led to a job offer. \u201ci\u2019m not sure if i would have applied to kpmg, or been interested in the same capacity, if not for the wework environment,\u201d pessah told me. \u201cit was an easy transition.\u201d  sita said wework will soon begin offering some enterprise members the ability to manipulate, to an extent, who works in a given location. he offered an example: say a large pharmaceutical brand wants to work with biomedical start-ups. wework would seek out congenial neighbors by tapping willing members or interested recruits. \u201cevery start-up wants to be an enterprise, and every enterprise a start-up,\u201d sita said. \u201cwe think we have a responsibility to curate some relationship between these two groups.\u201d  the upshot of such an arrangement is not just the stuff of wework\u2019s corporate talking points. prominent 20th-century urban theorists like jane jacobs and the economist robert lucas argued that dense packs of talented workers boost local economies and innovative thinking; recent data-backed research supports the theory. in a way, wework is taking the \u201ccreative clustering\u201d already happening in cosmopolitan centers and concentrating it even further, in a few thousand square feet of class-a office space.    what does that mean for the average co-worker? wework will try to \u201cbalance\u201d the mix of members by location, sita said. he stressed that start-ups can benefit from proximity to blue chips, whether through knowledge-sharing, contracting, or even acquisition. that makes sense, at least in some cases. but a future where co-working is made entirely of big fish and little fish content to swim in one transactional bowl is a future that seems to leave out a lot of other fish: the vegan-meal-kit makers, the community bail fund, and hey, the journalists. we, too, are working here. what would big business want with us? and what would  we  want with big business? the day may soon come when we\u2019re forced to repair to our dark basements\u2014because the economy cools off, or because wework has cooled on us.     this article appears in the march 2018 print edition with the headline \u201cbuilding a better office.\u201d    ",

(the dow\u2019s decline was closer to 2.5 percent.)  while those percentages may seem small, they represent notable drops for a market that has been on an  upward trajectory \u2014with only a few small and short-lived corrections\u2014for the better part of nine years.  why is this happening? the short answer is: panic over the possibility of higher interest rates. on friday morning, the bureau of labor statistics  released  its monthly jobs report, which showed that in january, average wages increased the most in any month since 2009. while that\u2019s good news for most americans, it can signal that inflation might soon increase, which might in turn cause the federal reserve to raise interest rates more quickly than expected\u2014making borrowing money more expensive for companies (and individuals). that\u2019s the sort of thing that might make investors think twice about putting their money into the market.  still, most analysts don\u2019t think that friday\u2019s performance spells trouble for the economy more broadly. instead, the correction, which many say is overdue, may signal that the market is returning to more-normal growth patterns, which include more volatility than has been seen in recent years.

veneer  of supermarket automation lurks an ugly truth: there\u2019s a lot of shoplifting going on in the self-scanning checkout lane. but don\u2019t call it shoplifting. the guys in loss prevention prefer \u201cexternal shrinkage.\u201d  self-checkout theft has become so widespread that a whole lingo has sprung up to describe its tactics. ringing up a t-bone ($13.99/lb) with a code for a cheap ($0.49/lb) variety of produce is \u201cthe banana trick.\u201d if a can of illy espresso leaves the conveyor belt without being scanned, that\u2019s called \u201cthe pass around.\u201d \u201cthe switcheroo\u201d is more labor-intensive: peel the sticker off something inexpensive and place it over the bar code of something pricey. just make sure both items are about the same weight, to avoid triggering that pesky \u201cunexpected item\u201d alert in the bagging area.    how common are self-scanning scams? if anonymous online questionnaires are any indication, very common. when voucher codes pro, a company that offers coupons to internet shoppers, surveyed 2,634 people, nearly 20 percent admitted to having stolen at the self-checkout in the past. more than half of those people said they gamed the system because detection by store security was unlikely. a 2015 study of self-checkouts with handheld scanners, conducted by criminologists at the university of leicester, also found evidence of widespread theft. after auditing 1 million self-checkout transactions over the course of a year, totaling $21 million in sales, they found that nearly $850,000 worth of goods left the store without being scanned and paid for.  the leicester researchers concluded that the ease of theft is likely inspiring people who might not otherwise steal to do so. rather than walk into a store intending to take something, a shopper might, at the end of a trip, decide that a discount is in order. as one retail employee told the researchers, \u201cpeople who traditionally don\u2019t intend to steal [might realize that] \u2026 when i buy 20, i can get five for free.\u201d the authors further proposed that retailers bore some blame for the problem. in their zeal to cut labor costs, the study said, supermarkets could be seen as having created \u201ca crime-generating environment\u201d that promotes profit \u201cabove social responsibility.\u201d  whether out of social responsibility or frustration with shrinkage, some retailers, including albertsons, big y supermarket, pavilions, and vons, have scaled back or eliminated self-scanning, at least in some stores. but others continue to add it. worldwide, self-checkout terminals are expected to number 325,000 by next year, up from 191,000 in 2013. in some places, meanwhile, the likelihood of being punished for petty shoplifting is decreasing. even if a manager wants to press charges, many police departments can\u2019t be bothered with supermarket theft. in 2012, for example, the dallas police department enacted a new policy: officers would no longer routinely respond to shoplifting calls for boosts amounting to less than $50. in 2015, the threshold was raised yet again, to $100.    perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that some people steal from machines more readily than from human cashiers. \u201canyone who pays for more than half of their stuff in self checkout is a total moron,\u201d reads one of the more militant comments in a reddit discussion on the subject. \u201cthere is no moral issue with stealing from a store that forces you to use self checkout, period. they are charging you to work at their store.\u201d barbara staib, the director of communications of the national association for shoplifting prevention, believes that self-checkouts tempt people who are already predisposed to shoplifting, by allowing them to rationalize their behavior. \u201cmost shoplifters are in fact otherwise law-abiding citizens. they would chase behind you to return the $20 bill you dropped, because you\u2019re a person and you would miss that $20.\u201d a robot cashier, though, changes the equation: it \u201cgives the false impression of anonymity,\u201d staib says. \u201cthis apparently empowers people to shoplift.\u201d  which isn\u2019t to say that all shoppers feel equally empowered. frank farley, a psychologist at temple university, says that many supermarket thieves have what he calls type-t (as in \u201cthrill\u201d) personalities: \u201cshopping can be quite boring because it\u2019s such a routine, and this is a way to make the routine more interesting. these can be risk-taking, stimulation-seeking people.\u201d according to this theory, some type ts become  base  jumpers or mafia hit men, while others settle for swiping brie and organic tomatoes from safeway.     this

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/H8y01Zc6VkA", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-02 07:00:00", "summary": " in a  recent letter  to listeners, minnesota public radio\u2019s president, john mctaggart, depicted damning  allegations  of sexual harassment against garrison keillor, the recently ousted host of the popular show  a prairie home companion . \u201cif the full 12-page letter or even a detailed summary of the alleged incidents were to be made public, we believe that would clarify why mpr ended its business relationship with garrison,\u201d he wrote. the statement is likely geared toward shocked fans, some of whom  criticized  the station for severing ties with keillor over what he said was a \u201c more complicated \u201d version of events. mctaggart\u2019s letter may quell some of mpr\u2019s critics, but it doesn\u2019t answer the bigger question many listeners have: how could keillor and so many other beloved public-media stars have gotten away with such inappropriate behavior for so long?  within the span of a few weeks, accusations against other high-ranking and well-known figures have surfaced in the public-broadcasting realm, leading to their dismissal or suspension from organizations including npr, wnyc, and wbur. there was  david sweeney  and  michael oreskes  and  charlie rose . and  john hockenberry ,  tom ashbrook ,  leonard lopate, and jonathan schwartz . there\u2019s something odd about how many of the allegations of sexual misconduct in the media industry have come out of public media\u2014with its reputation for thoughtfulness and civility. hollywood was one thing, with its legacy of casting couches, hypersexualization of women, and clear gender imbalances\u2014but gentle, egalitarian public radio?  the industry\u2019s swift and aggressive response has been notable. stations have been quick to cut ties with those accused of sexual harassment. that stands in contrast to the choices made by other organizations who have sometimes chosen  different and less severe  forms of censure, such as the reassignment of glenn thrush at  the new york times  or the  six-month sabbatical  taken by pixar\u2019s john lasseter.  according to the corporation for public broadcasting (cpb), a nonprofit formed in 1967 to act as a steward for the federal government\u2019s investments in public broadcasting, the  purpose of public media  is to \u201cprovide programs and services that inform, educate, enlighten, and enrich the public and help inform civil discourse essential to american society.\u201d and that mandate requires the \u201cdevelopment of content that involves creative risk and that addresses the needs of unserved and underserved audiences, especially children and minorities.\u201d this guiding premise tasks public media with upholding a higher moral standard than for-profit media, and many presume that by virtue of working there, its employees adhere to those standards too. that\u2019s part of what makes these allegations so difficult for audiences to stomach.  public media is donor-based, meaning these outlets must appeal for their audiences\u2019 support. in recent years, individual giving has  increased  for local public-radio funding and broadcasts such as  pbs newshour . that may be part of what\u2019s driving dismissals in public broadcasting. a donor-supported model \u201cgives people a sense of ownership and investment that i think is different,\u201d pete vernon, a staff writer covering media for the  columbia journalism review , told me. when it comes to stations trying to manage the fallout of sexual harassment, they \u201cunderstand how bad the optics are on this, and they understand their listeners are now incensed about it.\u201d they also understand that, especially for smaller stations, their livelihood can depend on their ability to court donations.  public media is made up of a large constellation of local, independent radio and television stations, which receive federal funding to help them provide free programming and services to their local audience. these stations can differ vastly in size, audience, and resources. some choose to become member stations to national outfits such as public broadcasting service (pbs) or npr, which give them access to additional programming. but often smaller stations find themselves strapped for cash, which can inhibit the ability to build up human-resources departments, or train staff and leadership about how to create an inclusive and safe work environment. many of the outlets implicated in recent harassment allegations certainly don\u2019t qualify as small or under-resourced, but if stations aren\u2019t effectively managing these problems when they\u2019re still tiny, they can wind up with big problems as they grow. \u00a0  at wnyc, for example, the  newsroom grew  to around 70 workers up from three, in the span of about 20 years, according to  the new york times . *  but even as the station drew in more revenue and grew its staff,  some current and former employees told   the new york times  that human resources simply didn\u2019t keep pace. now, after the firings of john hockenberry, who hosted  the takeway ; \u00a0leonard lopate, who hosted  the leonard lopate show ; and jonathan schwartz, who hosted programs on american musical standards; laura walker, the president of new york public radio, has called for a review of hr policies related to harassment retaliation and discrimination. at a board meeting following the accusations of sexual harassment, walker said that she was \u201cprofoundly pained and sorry\u201d that the wnyc workplace \u201cdid not, at times, live up to the values our programming embodies.\u201d  while many people i spoke with say public media\u2019s harassment problem isn\u2019t worse than other segments of media, it\u2019s clear that the systems in place to cope with issues of sexual harassment have been woefully inadequate. julie drizin, the executive director of  current , a nonprofit publication focused on public media, says that the lack of robust human-resources departments that would include training and specific reporting mechanisms in instances of harassment may be a part of the problem, at least at some stations. \u201ca lot of corporations invest a lot more in hr. i think that\u2019s one of the things that separates public media from other kinds of media,\u201d she says.  still, even with its well-known deficiencies, public media doesn\u2019t quite fit the stereotypes of a male-dominated, hostile work environment. vivian schiller, the former ceo of national public radio, told me that public broadcasting, particularly npr, has long been considered a space where women can thrive. \u201cwhen i was there, most of the leadership was women,\u201d schiller said. in fact, four women, cokie roberts, nina totenberg, linda wertheimer, and susan stamberg, are often referred to as the \u201c founding mothers \u201d of npr. and the organization\u2019s  most recent data  on newsroom makeup shows that more than half of newsroom employees are women. the fact that a culture of harassment and bullying were allowed to fester for for years, all while women sat in positions of  power  and control, makes the issue all the more confusing. but if you consider the  discord  on other issues, such as between public media\u2019s stated commitment to diversity and its predominantly white audiences and newsrooms, it\u2019s clear that the overarching vision of public broadcasting often doesn\u2019t manifest in real and critical ways.  schiller told me that she was shocked by the wave of allegations, and even more so by the fact that so many at npr had remained quiet about them for so long. \u201cmy experience with the npr newsroom is that they had absolutely no hesitation to speak out about things that they felt weren\u2019t right, unfair, or that were bothering them,\u201d she said. she sees the recent upheaval in a positive light\u2014an indication that public media is going to be a leader when it comes to coping with these issues. \u201cthere is a seriousness of purpose to make things right, and to try to fix whatever systems were and weren\u2019t in place that allowed this to happen,\u201d she said.  for now though, most stations i spoke with are still in the process of conducting investigations to determine just how far issues of discrimination go, and what systems have allowed them to flourish. as public broadcasting attempts to cope with its #metoo moment, leadership will have make sense of the dissonance of widespread sexual harassment in a space known for nurturing women\u2019s careers.\u00a0 they may find themselves facing other contradictions, as well\u2014 such as persistent racial inequality in a space that has a mandate to be thoughtful about diversity. stations have an opportunity not only to contend with individual harassers or failing policies, but to also think broadly about how to create newsrooms that live up to the values public media purports to uphold.

(an amazon spokeswoman, nina lindsey, told me that, like most companies, amazon has performance expectations, but that it supports people not performing with dedicated coaches to help them improve.)  meanwhile, gabriel watched as his 39-year-old brother jose worked across the street, doing the same type of job at a warehouse for the grocery chain stater brothers. the 1,000 workers there are unionized and get full medical benefits, pensions, and retiree medical benefits. wages start at $26 an hour, but many workers make a lot more than that because stater brothers operates an incentive program in which people who grab orders\u2014doing similar tasks to workers at amazon\u2014are rewarded if they go faster than the average speed. jose alvarado is able to support a wife and four children on his stater brothers salary. when his son was diagnosed with a rare form of anemia, his insurance covered everything.  though gabriel was doing the same type of work at amazon, he had to shell out more money for health care, and made a lot less money. \u201ci saw my brother doing the same type of work, but moneywise, he had better credit, he could afford more, while i was barely getting by,\u201d gabriel told me. he has tried to get a job with stater brothers to no avail, and says there are few other local options but at amazon or at companies that work for amazon. in 2016, he used amazon\u2019s tuition reimbursement to get his commercial driving license, attending school on the weekends while working during the week. but the best job he could find was working for a third-party contractor, driving a truck for amazon. \u201cit\u2019s either amazon or nothing,\u201d he told me.  the lack of other opportunities for people like gabriel alvarado illuminates the problem these communities face when deciding to offer tax breaks and incentives to compete for amazon to build warehouses in their towns. if these places don\u2019t get a new amazon facility, they won\u2019t instead get companies like stater brothers that are willing to come in and pay double or triple the minimum wage for jobs that don\u2019t require a college education. for many places, the choice is not between amazon or another, better employer. the choice, instead, is amazon or nothing. \u201cthere\u2019s this way in which amazon\u2019s warehouses are perceived to be a good thing for a community, but that\u2019s only because the context in which they are being proposed and built is so devoid of better opportunities,\u201d said stacy mitchell, the co-director of the institute for local self-reliance, a nonprofit that advocates for sustainable community development. \u201cit\u2019s an indicator of how badly our economy is doing in terms of providing meaningful and valuable opportunities for people.\u201d  morris, the former mayor of san bernardino, told me that in 2012, amazon seemed like a lifesaver. san bernardino\u2019s unemployment rate was at 15 percent, home values had fallen 57 percent since 2007, and the city, facing a $45 million budget shortfall, would file for bankruptcy in august of that year. \u201cat the point they came in, any job is a good job,\u201d he said. but the jobs the company is offering are indicative of how the economy has changed in san bernardino in the past few decades. \u201cto a certain extent, based on the history, it\u2019s a step down for families,\u201d he said. the jobs that used to dominate san bernardino were unionized ones with good benefits, at the kaiser steel mill, the santa fe railroad maintenance yard, and the norton air force base. now, jobs like the ones amazon creates pay less and aren\u2019t unionized, and require multiple members of a household to work, often more than one job.  as amazon continues to grow at a rapid clip, more communities are in the same position as san bernardino\u2014desperate to attract new jobs, even ones that pale in comparison to past opportunities, in the absence of anything else. although efforts to recruit new distribution centers garner less national attention than the race to attract amazon\u2019s hq2\u2014 its second corporate headquarters, where the company is expected to add as many as 50,000 jobs\u2014when added up, these other facilities create a large number of jobs. amazon now has 342 facilities, including fulfillment centers, prime hubs, and sortation centers, in the united states, up from 18 in 2007, according to mwpvl international, a supply-chain and logistics consulting firm. amazon employed 180,000 people in the united states in 2016, and said  last year  that it planned to add more 100,000 full-time, full-benefit jobs by mid-2018.     the company is a microcosm of the growing logistics industry, which is booming as more and more people order goods online. the company is growing even in places where it already has a substantial presence: although it already has eight fulfillment centers near san bernardino, amazon  recently announced  it was adding two more facilities nearby, creating 2,000 more jobs.  a mazon allows visitors  to tour one of its warehouses in san bernardino, and i went late last year to try and understand how distribution centers work. the warehouse, called ont2 internally, is a vast complex, where clean concrete floors stretch out in all directions covering the distance of about 16 football fields. bright yellow posts divide the different sections of the building, where people unpack shipments, load shelves, unload shelves, and pack everything from puzzles to lightbulbs into amazon\u2019s ubiquitous brown boxes. conveyor belts covering several miles whir throughout the facility, moving goods among floors.  for local residents, starting work in this facility or one like it can seem like a blessing. at around $12 an hour, 40 hours a week, full-time jobs pay higher than many others in the region, and the benefits are also better than many other jobs in the industry. but workers are required to be on their feet all day, and receive scant time for bathroom breaks or lunch. they\u2019re pressured to meet certain production goals and are penalized by getting \u201cwritten up\u201d\u2014the first step in getting fired\u2014for not meeting them, they say. they\u2019re also allowed very little time off, and written up if they go over a certain amount of time off, these workers say, even if they get sick. this is according to in-depth conversations i\u2019ve had with 10 current and former amazon employees. these employees work in the san bernardino facility, as well as amazon distribution and sortation centers in moreno valley, california; jeffersonville, indiana; and kent, washington. amazon has been sued in the past by part-time, contract workers. all but one of the people i interviewed were full-time employees, not contract workers, and they didn\u2019t think working directly for amazon was so great, either. as one worker, john burgett, a current employee in indiana who has detailed his experiences on the blog  amazon emancipatory , told me, \u201cit\u2019s very physically and emotionally grueling. they\u2019re walking a fine line in the community\u2014everybody knows someone who\u2019s worked there, and no one says it\u2019s a good place to work.\u201d     number of amazon facilities over time      mwpvl international    many people who start out at amazon warehouses begin as \u201cpickers.\u201d these are the people who walk through the vast aisles in the amazon warehouses where goods are stored, and, reading information from a handheld scanner, put items that have been ordered online into yellow bins, called totes. the scanner gives pickers an amount of time to \u201cpick\u201d an item based on where it is stored, and blue bars on the scanner count down the amount of time they have left to complete the task. slightly more desirable than picking is stowing. \u201cstowers\u201d take bins of items that have been shipped to amazon and store them on the shelves for the pickers to grab when ordered. other employees work as \u201cpackers.\u201d they take items from yellow totes, scan them, grab a box and packing tape, the size of which is recommended by a computer, and pack individual customers\u2019 orders, putting the finished boxes on a fast-moving conveyor belt.  the workers i talked to said that the problem with these jobs is not just that they\u2019re physical or monotonous\u2014which they are\u2014but, rather, that amazon puts an incredible amount of pressure on people to continue to work faster and faster. many of the employees mentioned the fear of being \u201cwritten up\u201d and losing their jobs, which will thrust them into other low-paid jobs with fewer benefits. if pickers don\u2019t grab an item in a certain amount of time, they get written up. if they take too long a bathroom break, they get written up. if they\u2019re not walking as fast or performing as well as the majority of employees, they get written up. \u201cyou constantly feel like, \u2018i\u2019m not doing enough, i need to do a little more,\u2019 and that\u2019s their business model,\u201d burgett said. \u201cthe constant trying to chase your rate, trying to stay ahead of being written up\u2014it affects you psychologically.\u201d this pressure is not limited to warehouse workers; a 2015   new york times  story  detailed a corporate culture where white-collar workers were pushed psychologically as well.  another man, a former carpenter who works in the stow department in moreno valley who didn\u2019t want his name used because he still works for amazon, said that without warning, amazon changed the amount of time workers had to stow an item from six minutes to four minutes and 12 seconds. \u201cthey make it like the hunger games,\u201d he said. \u201cthat\u2019s what we actually call it.\u201d workers are competing against an average time, and so they are, in essence, competing against each other. those who can\u2019t keep up are written up and then fired, he said.  another moreno valley employee, who has been a picker at amazon for two-and-a-half years, says the company constantly sends messages to workers\u2019 scanners telling them to work faster. they\u2019ll run competitions such as a \u201cpower hour\u201d in which workers are encouraged to work as hard as they can for a prize. one recent prize was a cookie. another time, the winner of power hour would be entered into a raffle to win a gift card. \u201ci don\u2019t want a cookie or a gift card. i\u2019ll take it, but i\u2019d rather a living wage. or not being timed when you\u2019re sitting on the toilet,\u201d said the man, who lives with his father because he and his girlfriend can\u2019t afford their own place ,  and didn\u2019t want his name used because he hopes to get promoted at amazon.    an amazon worker stows goods in the san bernardino facility. (alana semuels / the atlantic)   one woman i talked to in moreno valley, who didn\u2019t want her name used because she is in the process of suing amazon, said that working at the company strained her heart and caused her psychological problems that she\u2019s still dealing with. she was written up for not working enough hours after she went to the emergency room because of her heart problem, she says. on the other hand, she says, she made enough money at amazon to buy her first new car. \u201cthat\u2019s what makes people not want to quit\u2014the pay,\u201d she said. \u201cpeople say, \u2018you can treat me any type of way, since this is the best money we can get out here in moreno valley.\u2019\u201d  i did talk to one amazon worker who started as a picker and made his way up to management. david koneck, now 34 years old, was one of the first workers hired by amazon when the san bernardino facility first opened. at the time, koneck, who graduated from high school but not from college, was running a company that administered diagnostic tests for high-school students. that job was unstable in the aftermath of recession-era budget cuts, so when amazon announced it was hiring, he applied right away, attracted by the benefits like health insurance and a program that allowed him and his wife to share paid leave when they had their first child. he started by working as a picker on the night shift, and within nine months was promoted. both were good jobs, he told me\u2014he and his wife bought their first house, in hesperia, california, while he was an hourly associate. (public records show it cost $182,500.) the company gave him lots of opportunities to move up and receive training in different areas, he said. after two years with the company, he was promoted again, and moved into management. today, he\u2019s an operations manager. \u201ci wanted to come in here and achieve as much as i could, and nothing has stood in my way,\u201d he told me. \u201cit\u2019s been nothing but positive support for me.\u201d he\u2019s now trying to help other hourly associates move up the amazon ladder.  amazon says that many employees have similar experience to koneck. at one kentucky facility, according to lindsey, the   amazon spokeswoman, there are more than 100 employees who have been with amazon for more than 15 years. but the workers i talked to say few employees make it more than a year. their theory was that amazon begins to cull employees when they are reaching the two-year mark, at which point their stock options would vest. (lindsey says it is \u201cstrongly\u201d in amazon\u2019s interest to retain employees to provide them with opportunities to develop, because the company is growing so quickly.) the former carpenter says employees call workers approaching the two-year mark \u201cthe walking dead\u201d because they are working hard not to get fired, but many of them will be. \u201cvery few tier one employees ever make it to two years of continuous service,\u201d burgett writes. anecdotally, he estimates that about 5 percent of new hires receive vested stock shares. \u201cthere are only two options,\u201d gabriel alvarado told me. \u201cyou get tired\u2014tired of trying to make rate every week, tired of the write-ups\u2014or you get fired because you didn\u2019t make quota or run out of unpaid time off.\u201d associates receive 10 hours of paid time off when they begin, lindsey told me, which is essentially one day off. most associates work four 10-hour shifts a week and only accrue a small amount of paid time off every pay period, workers said, which means it can take months to get another day off.  \u201cwhen we\u2019re thinking about amazon coming in and creating a huge number of jobs, what\u2019s the quality of jobs? we should also be really examining that,\u201d said beth gutelius, a researcher at the great cities institute at university of illinois at chicago who wrote her dissertation about the warehouse industry in the chicago suburbs. \u201csometimes these more exurban areas are really desperate for jobs, and you can\u2019t deny that, but places do have to really think hard about it.\u201d  c urrent officials  in san bernardino maintain that amazon\u2019s presence has been a positive one. the new mayor, r. carey davis, told me that the city has seen a number of benefits since amazon opened its first warehouse. the company has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to local schools and charities, for example. \u201cthe city of san bernardino has found that amazon has been a very good neighbor and private partner for the city of san bernardino,\u201d he said. amazon\u2019s presence has signaled to other cities that san bernardino is a good place to locate, with qualified workers, and an efficient city government, said mike burrows, the executive director of the inland valley development agency and the san bernardino international airport authority. it\u2019s helped create jobs on the land once used by the norton air force base until it closed two decades ago. amazon recently surpassed stater brothers, which had been the largest employer on the land formerly occupied by the air force base with 2,000 employees, according to the inland valley development agency. now, amazon has 4,900 employees in san bernardino.  the arrival of amazon may have been good for other businesses in the inland empire, but its effects on individual residents seem less positive. while warehousing and storage was one of the fastest-growing sectors in the inland empire over the past decade, adding 35,800 jobs, the area also has the  lowest  annual private-sector average wage out of the country\u2019s 50 largest metropolitan areas. a  report  from the institute for local self-reliance found that amazon paid 11 percent less than the average warehouse in the inland empire; a similar  analysis  by  the economist  found that workers earn about 10 percent less in areas where amazon operates than similar workers employed elsewhere.    kevork djansezian / getty   there is potential for amazon to be the shining knight that city officials hope it will be when it opens in their cities. amazon could become more like stater brothers\u2014paying workers more, incentivizing efficiency rather than punishing workers who fall behind, supporting efforts to form a union. it could treat workers like jose alvarado is treated. after 11 years at stater brothers, alvarado, who also plays on the company softball team, has no plans to leave. \u201ci\u2019m able to support my whole family and live a really good life,\u201d he told me, a stark contrast to his brother.  but that would require a wholesale change in amazon\u2019s business practices, which would probably not sit well with consumers who have become accustomed to free shipping and cheap goods. (amazon is losing money on its e-commerce operations, which are subsidized by other parts of its business. )  \u201cmore opportunity for folks with less education is generally a good thing,\u201d said gutelius, the chicago researcher. \u201cit would be a much better thing if the job quality were better, if there were some real kind of job ladder over time,\u201d she said.  efforts to get amazon to change its labor practices have been unsuccessful thus far. randy korgan, the business representative and director of the teamsters local 63, which represents the stater brothers employees, told me that his office frequently gets calls from amazon employees wanting to organize. but organizing is difficult because there\u2019s so much turnover at amazon facilities and because people fear losing their jobs if they speak up. burgett, the indiana amazon worker, repeatedly tried to organize his facility, he told me. the turnover was so high that it was difficult to get people to commit to a union campaign. the temps at amazon are too focused on getting a full-time job to join a union, he said, and the full-time employees don\u2019t stick around long enough to join. he worked with both the local seiu and then the teamsters to start an organizing drive, but could never get any traction. he told me that whenever amazon hears rumors of a union drive, the company calls a special \u201call hands\u201d meeting to explain why a union wouldn\u2019t be good for the facility. (lindsey said that amazon has an open-door policy that encourages associates to bring concerns directly to the management team. \u201cwe firmly believe this direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the needs of our workforce,\u201d she wrote, in an email.)  gabriel alvarado, too, said he talked with some friends about starting a union in san bernardino, after contrasting his situation with that of his brother. amazon soon called a meeting and asked workers what they wanted to make their jobs better, he says, but few of the workers\u2019 suggestions were carried out. no amazon warehouse has been organized thus far. in 2014, workers at an amazon warehouse in middletown, delaware, voted 21\u20136 against joining the international association of machinists and aerospace workers. burgett thinks these outcomes are the result of, what he calls in his blog, amazons \u201cwell-oiled and well-financed anti-union machinery.\u201d  t here are many   other reasons  communities might pause before welcoming an amazon warehouse. but many still welcome the company, believing that it\u2019s better to have some jobs in the new amazon economy than no jobs at all. fresno, another economically depressed city in california,  offered  amazon $15.3 million in property tax rebates and $750,000 in sales tax rebates to locate a facility there, an offer amazon was happy to take up. amazon won $23 million in local tax incentives  over two years  to open distribution centers in three texas cities. the company has received $48 million in state, county, and city financial incentives to  build facilities  in florida.  this race to the bottom may be preventing cities from holding amazon\u2014or other logistics companies\u2014accountable. after all, most communities aren\u2019t in a position to negotiate with amazon to ensure that workers will be treated well. last year, i interviewed michael tubbs, the mayor of stockton, california, shortly after amazon announced  in august  that it was locating a distribution center and 1,000 jobs in the inland city in northern california. tubbs is young and progressive, but still told me that stockton had little power over amazon. \u201ci don\u2019t think the city of stockton currently, with an unemployment rate double the state average, is in a position to make a ton of demands on companies who can go anywhere,\u201d he told me. san bernardino had tried to negotiate that it would get a portion of the sales tax of all the goods that came through its distribution center, but ultimately spent money to build roads and provide police and fire protection to the warehouse and does not get any sales tax revenues from the warehouse, morris said. (the state of california, not amazon, quashed the deal.)  as the race for amazon\u2019s hq2 shows, other cities competing for amazon jobs offer up all sorts of concessions, and worry that in passing any wage and hour mandates, they\u2019ll lose the jobs. \u201ci think often, local policymakers are really eager to get companies in, they want employment, but they don\u2019t necessarily give a lot of stipulations about how many of these workers are temps, how many are paid a living wage,\u201d ellen reese, chair of the labor-studies program at the university of california, riverside, told me.  it\u2019s true that cities desperate for jobs may find it difficult to attract companies if they pass minimum-wage mandates or other labor laws. but the alternative, it seems, is jobs that don\u2019t create a middle-class lifestyle for residents, which in turn affects local spending, the housing market, the tax base, and leads to a poor standard of living. many cities, san bernardino included, are calculating that any job creation is good news. they may soon find that with amazon, that calculation does not apply.

(the other one is the series finale of  m*a*s*h .)  but this superlative legacy is in tension with an equal and opposite force: the steady collapse in nfl viewership. the size of the league\u2019s average per-game audience  has declined  by about 17 percent since 2015, an astonishing fall for the crown jewel of pay tv.  to explain the mystery of cascading football ratings, observers have pointed to several potential culprits. in the autumn of 2016, analysts  blamed  the election and donald trump\u2019s nonstop antics for pulling viewers\u2019 attention from football to the presidential campaigns. last year, they  blamed  players\u2019 protests and the president\u2019s relentless tweeting. but now evidence is mounting that the nfl\u2019s problems are deeper than political story lines and social-media distractions.  quite simply, televised football has a  television  problem and a  football  problem. the television problem is prominent yet simple. fewer people are subscribing to pay tv, which means that ratings are declining for just about everything on cable and broadcast. to pick an example quite different from football: the audience for last weekend\u2019s grammys telecast  declined  by nearly 10 million, a stunning 30 percent drop in one year that is related to the fact that  cord-cutting is accelerating , leaving fewer people (especially young people) with access to cable tv. attention has shifted from pay tv to mobile devices, which aggregate football highlights, stats, and fantasy scores, allowing more fans to closely follow the sport without actually watching it live on television.  the football problem, though, is more complicated, in part because there are so many fan conjectures and politically motivated conspiracy theories competing for explanatory power. are viewers turning away from football because of concussions? players\u2019 protests? donald trump\u2019s poisoning the league with political tweets? players  having too much fun ? players  not having enough fun ? there isn\u2019t much hard evidence to prove any of these hypotheses correct.  instead there is evidence, sometimes circumstantial and often crystal clear, that football has suffered as its most popular players and teams have disappointed, in various ways. nfl ratings peaked several years ago, when some of the greatest quarterbacks in history were in their record-setting primes and most of the league\u2019s most popular teams were competitive.  that\u2019s simply not the case anymore. many of the most popular and marketable players in the nfl in 2017 are either injured (like aaron rodgers, andrew luck, and j.j. watt), playing for mediocre or noncompetitive teams (like russell wilson, von miller, and eli manning), or both (like odell beckham jr.). it ought to concern the league that the remainder is composed mostly of quarterbacks aged 35 and over (tom brady, drew brees, ben roethlisberger). of the  10 nfl players with the best-selling jerseys , only one made the playoffs without being injured or suspended: tom brady.  compare this sorry picture to the nba, where  14 of the 15 players  with the best-selling jerseys are healthy and active, and 13 are projected to make the playoffs. basketball telecasts on espn and tnt are attracting  15 percent more viewers  than last year, even though their average viewership is still just  one-tenth  the size of sunday night football. the upshot is straightforward: live sports are blockbuster events that fans attend (either in person or virtually) to watch superheroic performances. when those superheroes are playing, ratings stabilize or rise. when those same players are just wearing sweatpants on the sidelines, ratings drop.  but it\u2019s not just a dearth of star players; the nfl also suffers when its most popular franchises are suffering. this has been particularly clear in the playoffs, which have shown some of the worst ratings declines of the year. an analysis by the media research firm moffettnathanson ranked the league\u2019s teams by internet traffic to their official websites. just four of the 13 most popular teams made the playoffs. but of the 10 least popular teams in the league, half of them made the postseason and played in the first round of the playoffs. it will surprise no one that ratings for that week were dismal, down 20 percent from the previous year.     the most popular nfl teams, by traffic to their websites      moffettnathanson    the implication is straightforward: ratings dive when the most popular teams take a dive, too. as long as the dallas cowboys, green bay packers, or another popular team is playing and winning and throwing touchdown passes all over the place, football audiences are still astronomical and fairly bulletproof. (indeed,  the six most-watched playoff games  from last year all involved the no. 2 packers or no. 4 steelers.) but when kansas city plays tennessee in the first round of the playoffs,  ratings plummet . by this analysis, tom brady\u2019s  super bowl\u2013clinching comeback  against the unheralded jacksonville jaguars may have saved nbc and its advertisers tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of captive attention.  and this is precisely why the decline and fall of the nfl is such a big deal for television\u2014and, truly, for much of the retail industry. television is a $70 billion advertising business, and the nfl is its keystone. the super bowl is by far the largest live broadcast event in the u.s. football accounts for almost half of fox\u2019s \u201cgross ratings points\u201d (a common proxy in the ad industry for audience reach) and at least one-eighth of the same measure for cbs, nbc, and espn. its demise will encourage more large media companies to merge\u2014as  disney and fox  have proposed and  cbs  is allegedly discussing\u2014and nudge even more commercial dollars to internet advertising companies, where google and facebook stand to benefit. football\u2019s rise to cultural dominance mirrored the ascent of pay tv as  the single best business model in american entertainment history . today, both industries are falling back to earth together.

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "img_loc": "http:https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/02/uber_truck_jobs/fb5ac279e.png", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-01 07:00:00", "summary": " the outlook for trucking jobs has been grim of late. self-driving trucks, several reports and basic logic have suggested, are going to wipe out truckers. trucking is going to be the next great automation bloodbath.  but a counter-narrative is emerging: no, skeptics in the industry, government, academia are saying, trucking jobs will not be endangered by autonomous driving, and in the brightest scenarios, as in  new research by uber\u2019s advanced technologies group , there may be an  increase  in trucking jobs as more self-driving vehicles are introduced.  \u201cwe\u2019ve been disappointed over the last year to see a lot of stories about how self-driving trucks are going to be this huge problem for truck drivers,\u201d says alden woodrow, the product lead for self-driving trucks at uber. \u201cthat\u2019s not at all what we think the outcome is going to be.\u201d  for one, uber does not believe that self-driving trucks will be doing \u201cdock to dock\u201d runs for a very long time. they see a future in which self-driving trucks drive highway miles between what they call transfer hubs, where human drivers will take over for the last miles through complex urban and industrial terrain.  for that reason, woodrow says that he saw their version of self-driving trucks as complementing humans, not replacing them. to make their case, uber created a model of the industry\u2019s labor market based on bureau of labor statistics data. then, they created scenarios that looked at a range of self-driving-truck adoption rates and how often those autonomous trucks would be on the road in comparison to human-driven vehicles.  their numbers for autonomous-truck adoption are intentionally very aggressive, woodrow says, corresponding to 25, 50, and 70 percent of today\u2019s trucks being self-driven. these do not reflect an uber prediction that between 500,000 and 1.5 million self-driving trucks will be on the road by 2028, but rather they allow the model to show the dynamics in the labor market that might result from widespread adoption. \u201cimagine that self-driving trucks are incredibly successful and impactful,\u201d he says. \u201cwhat would that mean?\u201d  the other set of numbers in the model\u2014the utilization rate of the self-driving trucks\u2014is the component that leads uber to a different analysis of the effect that these vehicles will have on truckers. basically, if the self-driving trucks are used far more efficiently, it would drive down the cost of freight, which would stimulate demand, leading to more business. and, if more freight is out on the roads, and humans are required to run it around local areas, then there will be a greater, not lesser, need for truck drivers.  \u201cif you believe the [automation] narrative that\u2019s out there today, it is especially counterintuitive,\u201d woodrow says, \u201cbecause the more self-driving trucks you have and the higher utilization they have, the more jobs it creates.\u201d    one of uber\u2019s scenarios of self-driving trucks stimulating growth in trucking jobs (uber)   this is not the story that\u2019s prevailed in the last couple of years. goldman sachs, for example, predicted trucker  job losses of 25,000 per month  as self-driving trucks roll out. mckinsey global institute put out a report with the  possibility of 1.5 million jobs lost  in trucking over the next 10 years. the international transport forum proposed that  2 million american and european truckers  could be directly displaced by 2030.  truckers, in fact, have become the go-to example for people who should be worried about robots taking their jobs. the technology for highway driving is very close to deployment, and therefore, these reports have assumed, the humans in the trucks will not be necessary soon.  but people within the trucking industry have always been  far more  skeptical about the potential for job displacement. they have argued that truckers don\u2019t just drive on highways. these jobs, in fact, require a wide variety of skills and the ability to operate in a host of unusual physical and social environments.  \u201cthere are so many things a driver does,\u201d says joe rajkovacz, the director of governmental affairs and communications at the western states trucking association. \u201ci just don\u2019t believe that you\u2019re ever going to see, at least in the world that\u2019s imagined right now, this fully autonomous truck without anyone in it.\u201d for example, he pointed out that if a self-driving truck breaks down a hundred miles from nowhere, a company would have to send a tow truck out into the vast spaces of the american west, whereas an onboard driver or operator could make a variety of basic fixes and continue the trip.  uber\u2019s woodrow agrees that drivers do an astonishing variety of things beyond driving. in his first days on the job, after arriving at uber from alphabet\u2019s x research wing, he took a ride from stockton to a cannery with a load of tomatoes, taking notes along the way about what the drivers he encountered were doing. \u201cthe drivers are getting in and out of the truck. they are moving axles. they are checking brakes, checking air hoses. they are talking to people. building a self-driving truck is not just about finding a way to have the truck drive in a straight line on a highway,\u201d he says. \u201cthere is so much to be done there before you get anywhere near being able to do the things that truck drivers are doing in an industrial facility or even on surface streets.\u201d  over time, rajkovacz has become a believer that the technology could make truckers\u2019 lives better, not necessarily by changing where they drive, but how. \u201cin a perfect world, i could hop in the bunk in salt lake city, optimize my speed settings for fuel economy, literally set it at 55, and say, \u2018i\u2019m taking my siesta,\u2019 wake back up, and take over in reno,\u201d he says. \u201ci get that people think i\u2019m smoking bird shit, but that\u2019s what we are ultimately talking about with this technology.\u201d    a test driver pulls the old \u201clook, no hands!\u201d inside an uber self-driving truck. (uber advanced technologies group)   making truckers\u2019 lives better seems like it should be the major focus for trucking companies. the industry regularly promotes that there is a huge shortage of truck drivers. they don\u2019t tend to mention that\u2019s because the jobs are so hard\u2014physically, emotionally, and economically\u2014that the industry is approaching 100 percent turnover per year, according to steve viscelli, a sociologist at the university of pennsylvania and author of  the big rig: trucking and the decline of the american dream . \u201cthe labor case for self-driving trucks is really pretty good,\u201d viscelli says. \u201cyou got this crappy job that no one really wants to do long-term.\u201d  people can be away from their families for 200 days a year. most young people are not willing to make that trade-off. so, right now, and in the foreseeable future as the trucking workforce continues to age, there are likely to be too  few  drivers, not too many.    uber foresees a transformation of the kind of trucking that\u2019s done by humans. (uber)   this might change in uber\u2019s scenarios. the deployment of transfer hubs\u2014or what viscelli has more evocatively called \u201ctruck ports\u201d\u2014would mean that most working truckers stay fairly close to home. this would mean a major shift in the geographic structure of the work. right now, truckers can live in far-flung places where their wages go further. in a world filled with truck ports, the rising number of local trucking jobs would be more geographically concentrated around centers of production and consumption. northern california, yes. northern idaho, no. some of these long-haul truckers would find their wages dropping or lose their livelihoods as self-driving trucks drove down the cost of highway freight shipping.  that said, for most people, the truck port could be an improvement on the current situation.  \u201cthe truck port idea is great for a lot of reasons: congestion, fuel economy, which brings in greens and transportation planners, even your average commuter is going to be thrilled to have 10,000 trucks out of l.a.\u2019s 4 o\u2019clock congestion,\u201d says viscelli. \u201cthe big question is what those local jobs at the truck ports are going to look like.\u201d  right now, there is already a model of short-haul trucking in and out of (shipping) ports; it\u2019s called drayage. and those jobs, from everything i\u2019ve ever heard, are considered the worst in the business. \u201clocal, for-hire driving has traditionally been lower paid and has some of the worst labor abuses,\u201d viscelli said. \u201cand the quintessential example of this is port driving.\u201d  drayage truckers are paid on a per-load basis and end up bearing the brunt of any congestion at the port or on highways. the workforce in many coastal ports is primarily made up of immigrants without a lot of other options. they scrape by in small companies or as so-called owner-operators making very little money and working 18-hour days.  \u201cwhat uber is doing could end up creating good local jobs, but for that to happen, we have to have a robust enough policy framework to ensure that workers aren\u2019t mistreated,\u201d viscelli said. \u201cif you have labor that is poorly paid and treated, it\u2019ll be used inefficiently.\u201d  doug bloch, the political director of the teamsters joint council 7, which represents 100,000 teamsters in the west, had an even darker vision for how the truck-port model could play out.  \u201cthey are going to be creating more of a vicious circle. you\u2019ll have independent contract drivers hauling stuff between the hubs and they\u2019re just going to be more crappy jobs,\u201d bloch said. \u201cand what will end up happening is this further erosion in job quality and this erosion is going to exacerbate the problem of the truck-driver shortage and it could potentially undercut employers like ups, who have employees who make good wages and good benefits.\u201d  in an industry where workers are already disempowered by  a nasty labor model  that has held down wages and kept many truckers from receiving benefits, the introduction of new technology is not going to go well for workers, no matter how well-intentioned uber might be.  even bloch, though, thought the general vision embedded in the uber study of an increase in transfer hubs was likely. \u201cthere are definitely going to be jobs created by the changes in the supply chain,\u201d bloch said, though he hastened to add, \u201cbut i\u2019m not sure i agree that we\u2019re going to have a net job increase.\u201d    the impact that self-driving trucks would have on trucking jobs  seemed  obvious to people typing up reports on computers about the industry: of course, self-driving trucks would mean less truckers. but what\u2019s clear from the trucking-industry experts is that there is a lot about the job and the industry that has not been adequately captured in the studies that predict a job apocalypse. or as the western states trucking association\u2019s rajkovacz, who drove a truck for nearly 30 years, says, \u201ci got more time sitting on the shitter in a truck stop than these people have spent driving trucks.\u201d  in particular, the question has been approached as a technology issue, rather than a social or political one. \u201cthis model makes sense only if you fundamentally refactor the way we do wages in trucking,\u201d says karen levy, a cornell university sociologist who studies trucking and technology. \u201cand uber can\u2019t do that itself.\u201d  but uber  is  a much more powerful entity than a bunch of disconnected, basically freelance truck drivers who couldn\u2019t even collectively bargain if they wanted to, thanks to the sherman antitrust act. uber might be able to push for changes in how truckers get paid,  especially  for waiting time at the end points for pickups and drop-offs, which is currently unpaid in most cases.  \u201cit sucks that maybe this company is the one we have to rely on to make these broad changes, but i\u2019m kind of putting my eggs in this basket,\u201d levy says. \u201cthe government can\u2019t and won\u2019t. the truckers don\u2019t have the political power. it comes at a convenient time for uber, too because they need to do some good stuff.\u201d  in the end, every expert i talked to for this story, from the teamsters to academia, believes that the broad strokes of uber\u2019s analysis have some merit and represent a potential positive path for autonomous trucking to play in the labor market.  \u201ci was prepared to read this proposal and say, \u2018ugh! you\u2019re the worst!\u2019\u201d levy says. \u201cbut as long as uber makes pushes on the organizational and regulatory front as they\u2019re making these technical pushes, there might be something here.\u201d  ", "kwds": ["the", "outlook", "for", "trucking", "jobs", "has", "been", "grim", "of", "late", "self", "driving",

trust. race, immigration, the empire state building. civil-service reform, north korea, manufacturing. president donald trump\u2019s state of the union speech addressed a broad sweep of issues. but one central economic topic went notably missing: the country\u2019s growing annual deficits and its increasing burden of debt.  the omission was a sign of the remarkable volte-face the republican party has taken on the country\u2019s fiscal situation in just a few years. republicans spent the early years of the recovery obsessed with the national debt, castigating democrats for their supposed irresponsibility, warning about the dangers of the almighty bond market, and helping to construct complicated mechanisms to slash federal outlays. they are now spending what might very well be the late years of the recovery ignoring it, having passed a tax plan that will add more to the debt than president obama\u2019s stimulus package did and having forgotten their once-urgent plans to make cuts to social security and medicare.  it might be nothing more than politics. shaming the other guy for doing something, and then doing it oneself as soon as one gets into power: it is cynical, it is hypocritical, it is washington. but it also reflects a profound change in policymakers\u2019 understanding of deficits and debt. maybe it is not that republicans should be more obsessed with the debt now. maybe it is that nobody in washington should have been so obsessed with the deficit back then.  back then, in this case, means 2010 through 2014, give or take. congress passed a trillion-dollar stimulus to help wrest the country back from free fall, and the economy entered a sluggish recovery from the pain of the recession. shortly after, republicans started whipping up concern over the country\u2019s fiscal situation, even as many economists from across the political spectrum argued that workers needed more help from deficit-financed stimulus. democrats, in many cases, agreed with their colleagues across the aisle, expressing deep concern over the long-term fiscal situation. next came a commission, endless budget negotiations, a tax increase, struggles with the debt ceiling, sequestration, a government shutdown.  more than anything else, there was obsession. obsession with the idea that the bond market would punish the united states like it punished greece, making the country\u2019s debt burden unsustainable, and soon. obsession with the idea of frivolous budgetary irresponsibility. \u201cin this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time,\u201d paul ryan, now the speaker of the house,  warned , adding that \u201cpresident obama has added more debt than any other president before him, and more than all the troubled governments of europe combined.\u201d  sure, republicans still cast themselves as the party of budgetary responsibility today. \u201cwe must impose firm caps on future debt, accelerate the repayment of the trillions we now owe in order to reaffirm our principles of responsible and limited government, and remove the burdens we are placing on future generations,\u201d the party\u2019s 2016  platform reads . and while president trump has never been much of a budget hawk, he did campaign on a promise to not just reduce the annual deficit, but to  balance the budget  outright and \u201crelatively quickly.\u201d  but how things have changed. president trump and congressional republicans pushed through a package of tax cuts financed almost entirely through deficit spending\u2014tax cuts that benefit corporations and the rich at the expense of the middle class and the working poor, no less. absent any other budgetary changes, the legislation will add an estimated $1.8 trillion to the country\u2019s debt over the  next 10 years . it is likely that the country\u2019s annual budget deficit will top $1 trillion next year, even if the unemployment rate remains low and the economy keeps growing.  with the tax cuts now law, republicans are seeking to increase deficits even further. gone are the promises to tackle entitlement reform, or to seek huge cuts from programs across the government. instead, republicans are pushing to shunt more money to military operations. \u201caround the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like china and russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values,\u201d president trump said, to rapturous applause, during tuesday\u2019s address. \u201cfor this reason, i am asking the congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.\u201d (democrats are negotiating over the increase, and are pushing for more money for the opioid epidemic and disaster relief.)  the rhetoric has changed too, with republicans no longer talking about the deficit and the debt in the heated, worried way they once did. during the 2016 gop debates, the  fiscal situation  came up far less often than it did in 2012, and with far less urgency too. the senate budget committee held  no dedicated hearings  on the debt, the deficit, fiscal stability, or balanced budgets in 2017, unlike in many years past. and, as a great   f  ivethirtyeight  analysis  has found, mentions of the deficit during congressional proceedings peaked at more than 8,000 in 2011 and fell to just more than 1,500 by 2015. for their part, administration officials refer to it infrequently, and often with little sense of outrage or concern. \u201cthe president is very much concerned about the rate of increase of the debt,\u201d steven mnuchin, the treasury secretary, said at a hearing of the senate banking committee this week. \u201cover time, we need to figure out where we can have government savings to deal with the deficit.\u201d  so what happened? how did the same republicans who balked at a stimulus to get the country out of a recession rubber-stamp a bigger stimulus to fuel the best economy since the 1990s? how are the same republicans who  helped to construct  an automatic mechanism to slash spending now lifting caps, spending more, and leaving entitlement programs untouched?  i asked both democratic and republican aides those questions, and got mostly shrugs. in some sense, president trump is just doing what presidents george w. bush and ronald reagan did before him, aided by republicans in congress. both swore to balance the budget or to bring down the debt. both signed legislation that increased deficits instead, primarily through tax cuts and increased military spending.  many democrats, for their part, now believe that republicans exploited their sincere concern over the long-term fiscal situation to score short-term political points\u2014with some democrats privately vowing not to worry about paying for things once they are back in power. \u201crepublicans never really cared about the budget deficit. it was always a political tactic. with their own tax cut, they said, \u2018go ahead and finance it with massive deficit spending,\u2019\u201d jared bernstein, an obama economic adviser, told me. democrats struggled to ensure everything they did was paid for, while, bernstein argues, \u201crepublican fiscal irresponsibility has enabled them to provide all kinds of goodies to their donor base.\u201d  but washington\u2019s understanding of the economic situation has changed, too, as bernstein admits. it now seems clear that the degree of deficit panic whipped up in the post-crisis years overestimated the risk of a bond-market reaction, overstated the risk of the government crowding out private investment, and underestimated the capacity of the united states government to run deficits and build up debts\u2014as well as overestimating how much voters ever really cared about the deficit. \u201cif you go around yelling about pressure on interest rates and public borrowing crowding out private, you don\u2019t have a lot to point to in terms of data,\u201d bernstein told me. \u201cyou have virtually nothing in terms of data. that\u2019s not just here. that\u2019s in japan, other advanced economies as well.\u201d  the risk that the country would not be able to fight a future recession due to its heavy debt burden might have been overinterpreted, as well. \u201cit\u2019s something the left has invented because they lost the tax war,\u201d doug holtz-eakin, the former director of the congressional budget office and a republican economic analyst, told me. the country has room to expand its budget deficits even now, he said. \u201cif we were in a position where additional tax cuts or spending would be beneficial in a rapid way to help a falling economy, markets would reward, not punish, you for that.\u201d  plus, broad segments of the public seem uninterested in punishing even archconservative politicians who increase the debt, despite the promises of the tea party. indeed, the many seem not to care much about the debt at all, now that washington has stopped talking about it. the share of americans who say that they  see the deficit  as a top priority has fallen to 48 percent today from 72 percent in 2013, according to a survey by the pew research center. corporate executives used to travel to washington to express their concern over the country\u2019s fiscal future. but on the tax legislation, they mostly remained mum. \u201cvoters, frankly, after these huge deficits, are saying, \u2018well, how much do deficits really matter?\u201d rick santorum, the former republican presidential candidate, told  the associated press  last september. \u201cwe\u2019re not greece yet, right?\u201d  of course, the country\u2019s true budget hawks remain unmoved\u2014and continue to push for putting the country on a different fiscal path. \u201chigh debt is a drag on the economy, and the more positive effects of the tax bill will eventually be overtaken by historic red ink. the president also did not address the ongoing need to address our nation\u2019s largest entitlements, which need to be strengthened,\u201d maya macguineas, the president of the committee for a responsible federal budget, said in a statement after president trump\u2019s address. \u201cwe sincerely hope president trump and congress lay out a plan soon to put it on a downward and sustainable path. an excellent first step would be to agree to stop making it worse.\u201d  but for now, nobody from either side of the aisle seems to want to listen. \u201cthe thing i can\u2019t say for sure but i wonder about is what happens when we hit $1 trillion in annual deficits,\u201d holtz-eakin told me. \u201cwhen it happened back in 2010, people flipped out.\u201d given how washington\u2019s shouts about the debt have fast become whispers, that seems unlikely.

it\u2019s not clear.  while jpmorgan and berkshire hathaway are listed as partners in the endeavor, amazon would seem to be the galvanizing force behind the announcement. in the last year, the company has  explored several health-care businesses , by selling more medical supplies, expanding its inventory of drug products, and hiring an executive to build a possible pharmacy business. these moves have already  so spooked the pharmacy and insurance industries  that they  reportedly pushed  cvs to place a $69 billion bid for the insurance giant aetna.  across the economy, amazon has become a kind of deflationary death star, so well-known for its high-volume, low-profit model that stocks plummet in every sector it threatens to enter. indeed, within minutes of the announcement,  shares fell  for pharmacy managers and drugmakers. as of 10:30 a.m. tuesday, large insurance companies like anthem and unitedhealth group were trading down about 5 percent, while the largest hospital companies, like hca, ticked up 8 percent. this suggests that investors believe the new health-care company will compete most directly with insurance firms and pharmacies rather than with hospitals and larger clinics. even so, if the corporate trio really wants to bring down health-care costs, they might try to open a network of low-cost clinics throughout the country that compete with large hospitals for less-complicated care.  if health care is, as buffett describes, a hungry tapeworm, the parasite isn\u2019t growing as fast as it used to. the rate at which medical costs increase each year has, with some exceptions, generally declined since the 2000s. between 2010 and 2013, the average annual growth rate in health expenditures was scarcely higher than that of gdp. as the economy picked up in 2014 and 2015, medical-cost inflation  turned up again .     consumer price index for all urban consumers: medical care      fred    for amazon to take the lead in taming medical-cost inflation continues an interesting trend in tech, with visionaries like jeff bezos, bill gates, and elon musk taking on the traditional roles of government, whether by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on basic research, sending rockets to space, revolutionizing infrastructure, or building new health-care companies. it might seem a bit ironic that three for-profit corporations would seek to create a nonprofit institution to do what traditionally has been done by the ultimate nonprofit institution\u2014the u.s. federal government. then again, at a time when libertarian corporate interests  have taken over washington , the work of governance is being outsourced, fittingly, to corporations.

(the gender pay gap exists even at the very bottom of the labor market\u2014the men on the farm were making an average of $45, according to the lawsuit.) what she wasn\u2019t spending on food or rent she was sending back home. \u201cmy family was really desperately in need of financial support and i was worried about them,\u201d she said. she felt it was hard to bring it up with other workers because the crew manager was always lurking, and when she did ask about it the others repeated the same refrain: he has papers and you don\u2019t, so there\u2019s nothing you can do. she threatened to quit; he threatened to kill her if she did, she says. \u201ci was really scared and felt like i couldn\u2019t leave,\u201d she said.  in recent months, stories of sexual harassment and assault have been flowing on a daily basis from the entertainment, media, and tech industries. but low-wage workers, who are disproportionately women of color, are extremely susceptible to harassment in the workplace, and their stories receive far less attention. according to  data compiled by the center for american progress  (cap) from the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc), more than one-quarter of sexual-harassment charges were filed in industries with large numbers of low-wage service-sector jobs. this is particularly stunning given that low-wage workers often have few other opportunities, and may not have much padding if they lose their jobs in response to filing a complaint. the analysis by cap found that almost three-quarters of the harassment cases include an allegation of retaliation.  in a  2012 human rights watch report , nearly all of the farmworkers interviewed said they had experienced sexual violence or harassment or knew someone who had. in 2010,  a study found  that of 150 mexican women working in the central valley in california, 80 percent had experienced sexual harassment. \u201ceighty percent\u2014that\u2019s a pandemic,\u201d noelle damico, from the national economic and social rights initiative, told me. after explosive allegations of sexual assault against the hollywood mogul harvey weinstein, alianza nacional de campesinas, an association of farmworker women,  submitted a signed letter of solidarity  with the women of hollywood: \u201cwe wish that we could say we\u2019re shocked to learn that this is such a pervasive problem in your industry. sadly, we\u2019re not surprised because it\u2019s a reality we know far too well.\u201d  \u201cthe history of agriculture in the u.s. always been one of sexual violence,\u201d said m\u00f3nica ram\u00edrez, the president of alianza nacional de campesinas, who comes from a family of farmworkers. \u201con farms, conditions are ripe for it.\u201d  \u201cthis entire industry was founded on a system of slaves, who were brought over and who suffered more greatly than we do even today, \u201c said nely rodriguez, a former farmworker who now is a senior staff member and leader of the coalition of immokalee workers (ciw). \u201cthose roots remain generation after generation,\u201d she told me over the phone through a translator.  in the second half of the 19th century,  on the heels of the mexican\u2013american war  and the abolition of slavery, mexican immigrants grew as a share of the american agricultural workforce. tens of thousand of migrant workers traveled between the u.s. and mexico with few restrictions.  in 1942, the u.s. and mexico created the bracero program, which allowed for millions of mexican men to come across the border for short-term work, predominantly in agriculture. although the program has long been abolished, the modern guest-worker visas perpetuate the industry\u2019s reliance on inexpensive, plentiful foreign labor in agriculture. the h-2a visa, a temporary work visa issued for seasonal agricultural work, offers limited protection to workers, creating a power dynamic that sets the stage for labor exploitation and sexual harassment. recruitment is a major pressure point with this visa, which permits an employee to only work for a single employer. if a worker is unhappy and wants to quit, her only way out is to leave the country altogether. \u201cthe h-2a program is very difficult program because the employer has control,\u201d damico said. \u201cwhen you put that much control in the hands of an employer the situation is ripe for exploitation, through it doesn\u2019t mean it happens all the time.\u201d  for agricultural workers who are totally undocumented, the situation is even worse. in 2010 the  southern poverty law center interviewed 150 immigrant women  who were undocumented or spent time as undocumented workers in agriculture and food-processing jobs; all of them said harassment was a problem, and the majority had experienced it. like perez, these workers often don\u2019t know their rights and work in isolation. \u201cthey are in different parts of the country and don\u2019t even know where they are. particularly for a migrant relying on a crew leader or someone to literally drive them state to state,\u201d ramirez said. they are reliant on the job to meet their basic needs for food and shelter, and they don\u2019t speak english, and often don\u2019t speak spanish, but an indigenous language, such as mayan. \u201cthey can\u2019t access information to be able to get help. we have this huge problem with the immigration system and individuals don\u2019t have a pathways. perpetrators use their migration status to victimize them.\u201d  for perez, relief came with a flyer for the coalition of immokalee workers, given to her by a woman in a store. she called a hotline and two women came to her home. in april 2014, perez and six of her co-workers at c&c farms filed a federal lawsuit against the farm, its owners, and tapia-ortiz, alleging violations of four federal statutes, including the trafficking victims protections act, as well as various state-law claims. all seven workers were named only as john and jane does in the initial complaint because they feared for their safety.  in 2015, the workers  settled with the farm and its owners \u2014but not tapia-ortiz\u2014for full payment of back wages plus an equal amount in damages (the total sum to be paid was not disclosed). the attorney who represented the farm and its owners declined to comment beyond confirming in an email that \u201cthe matter was resolved fairly to the mutual satisfaction of the parties without any liability admitted\u201d by his clients. but although the farm and its owners did not admit liability, they agreed to change practices on the farm by hiring laborers directly instead of through contractors and implementing new policies in regard to sexual harassment, according to  a press release  issued by the law firm that represented the workers. the farm has since gone out of business.  tapia-ortiz, meanwhile, did not participate in the lawsuit. after being personally served with the complaint against him in april 2014, neither he nor any attorney representing him ever appeared in the case. \u00a0in june 2016, the court awarded a default judgment against tapia-ortiz\u2014a finding of liability based on his failure to appear\u2014to the five workers who alleged that tapia-ortiz recruited them to the farm job. in february 2017 those five workers were awarded $3.5 million in damages from tapia-ortiz. the claim has yet to be paid, according to susan french, the lawyer for the workers and the coalition of immokalee workers.  there are signs of change in the industry. organizations such as alianza nacional de campesinas and the coalition of immokalee workers have stepped in and pushed for important reforms and efforts within the industry. the coalition of immokalee workers has developed the fair food program to ensure major food suppliers purchased tomatoes from farms with good practices. it is a worker-developed partnership among farms, farmworkers, students, the faith community, and corporations. \u201cwe took deep experiential knowledge of what the issues are and turned that into a code of conduct and then went on to create all the necessary mechanisms to really change that power dynamic,\u201d rodriguez, the former farmworker and leader of the coalition of immokalee workers, said.  fair food farms have a code of conduct and a series of mechanisms for workers to report sexual harassment and a monitoring system to make sure farms comply. the effort also leverages the power of large corporations to help individual farmworkers. there are 14 companies on board so far, including walmart, mcdonald\u2019s, subway, whole foods and trader joe\u2019s. the system could be easily adapted to other industries, and ciw has already introduced it to dairy farms in vermont. it represents hope for workers in an industry where, for generations, there\u2019s been very little.

the world\u2019s elite business leaders gathered in davos that \u201camerica is open for business\u201d as he tried to balance that message with the \u201camerica first\u201d policies that he has put in place over the past year.\u00a0\u00a0  \u201cthe world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous america,\u201d trump told the audience at the world economic forum. \u201cthere has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the united states.\u201d  trump, who campaigned for the presidency as a voice opposed to\u00a0 globalization and the global elites, is the first sitting american president to attend davos since bill clinton in 2000. he told the audience that as president he \u201cwill always put america first,\u201d but added \u201camerica first does not mean america alone. when the u.s grows, so does the world.\u201d  the remarks, which were closely watched by an audience alarmed by what many in the global elite see as a u.s. retreat from the global trading system the country created, is at odds with the policies the trump administration has enacted after the president took office in january 2017. trump pulled the u.s. out of the trans-pacific partnership, a pacific region free-trade zone that included the region\u2019s largest economies and was viewed as a counterweight to china\u2019s growing influence in the region. trump hasn\u2019t hidden his disdain for the north american free-trade agreement and has been ambiguous about whether the u.s. will stay in the agreement that also includes canada and mexico. last week, he imposed tariffs on washing machines and solar panels made overseas, an action reminiscent of the trade wars of the 1980s. more such moves are expected.  the president says his actions are aimed solely at helping american workers; that the free-trade deals of the past hurt american workers more than it helped the u.s. economy; and that the tariffs were aimed at the advantage, in his view unfair, that countries like china and south korea enjoyed in their dealings with the u.s.  \u201cwe will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to the trading system,\u201d trump said friday. \u201conly by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the united states but for all nations.\u201d  that might be the case, but the president\u2019s rhetoric on trade and his seeming support for bilateral agreements\u00a0\u00a0over multilateral ones has alarmed other world leaders. davos, which has been a cheerleading club for globalization, has seen much indirect criticism of the u.s. from its allies. german chancellor angela merkel this week said unilateral solutions \u201cwould ultimately promote isolation and protectionism\u201d and u.k. prime minister theresa may said globalization had \u201cdelivered the greatest advances in prosperity we have ever known.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0  earlier this week, trump said he was open to the u.s. re-entering the tpp if it was fairer to the u.s. it\u2019s something he has said about nafta, as well, which the u.s. is renegotiating with the pact\u2019s other signatories. it\u2019s uncertain though whether the world will wait for the u.s. to re-engage with multilateral systems. canadian prime minister justin trudeau said this week that his country would join the tpp without the u.s.\u2014joining australia, japan, and other pacific rim nations.  but if the audience at davos is concerned by trump\u2019s position on free trade, it appeared positively giddy at the president\u2019s overhaul of the tax system. introducing trump on friday, klaus schwab, the wef\u2019s founder, said the overhaul would stimulate economic growth in both the u.s. and the world. trump, citing the economic gains made during his year in office\u2014to the economy, to the stock market, and the unemployment rate, welcomed the world\u2019s investors.  \u201camerica is the place to do business,\u201d he said. \u201cso come to america where you can innovate, create, and build.\u201d  ", "kwds": ["president", "trump", "told", "the", "world", "\u2019s", "elite", "business", "leaders", "gathered", "in", "davos",

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/3Cdd659nDNg", "pub_datetime": "2018-01-26 07:45:00", "summary": " lately it seems that, every week, a new group of media employees votes to join a union. on tuesday, a majority of employees at  slate   voted  to join the writers guild of america, east. this came a few days after newsroom employees of the  los angeles times   voted  to join the newsguild\u2013communications workers of america. two weeks before that vox media  recognized  the writers guild of america, east, as the union representative of their editorial and video staff.  these efforts are the latest in a slew of successful campaigns to unionize educated workers, not the traditional targets for labor organizers. in the past three years, employees of vice media,  thinkprogress ,  huffpost ,  the   intercept ,  salon ,  thrillist , and the now-defunct  gawker  have all joined unions. graduate students at columbia, yale, tufts, and brandeis have also voted to join unions. adjunct professors at seattle university formed a union in 2016, and employees at the legal group lambda legal  voted  to form a union in december.  labor advocates are declaring the wins for white-collar workers a new front for organizing, and indeed, labor has been making some progress in expanding its reach among educated workers. the number of people employed in professional and technical occupations who are members of unions grew by almost 90,000 last year, according to numbers  released  last week by the bureau of labor statistics. the fields of law, arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media all saw substantial gains in the share of workers who are in unions, ticking up from around 4 percent in 2010 to around 7 in 2017.  but these gains for unions are in stark contrast to the many high-profile failed efforts to organize less-educated workers in other parts of the country, usually outside cities. in 2017, after years of organizing, the united auto workers  lost a bid  to form a union at a nissan plant in mississippi. they  failed  to organize a chinese-owned auto-glass plant in ohio in november. the uaw similarly  lost a bid  to organize a volkswagen plant in tennessee in 2014. on january 19, for example, the nlrb announced that media employees at the  los angeles times  and professional employees at a pennsylvania charter school each voted to join a union. that same day the nlrb announced that drivers at a bakery in new jersey, drivers at a freight company in new york, and drivers for the hy-vee grocery chain in iowa all voted against joining a union, according to  nlrb data .  and while labor groups trying to organize low-wage workers in industries like fast food and the on-demand economy have made some gains in recent years, they have not created formal unions, but rather established  informal arrangements  that help workers. the share of workers who were members of unions in production, transportation, and material-moving occupations fell to 13.6 percent, from 16.2 percent in 2010, according to bureau of labor statistics data. in service occupations, that share fell to 9.9 percent from 11 percent in 2010.  the contrast, between the growing numbers of educated workers joining unions and the shrinking pool of blue-collar workers doing so, is yet another dynamic of an increasingly bifurcated american economy. as jobs for educated workers continue to proliferate in this economy, educated workers feel secure, sure that they\u2019ll be able to find more work if they lose their jobs. in some cases, that security may mean they feel they can advocate for a union, or stand up to employer threats to shut the workplace down if a union forms. blue-collar workers, by contrast, are competing for a smaller and smaller share of jobs in the economy, and thus may feel less willing to commit to labor drives. of the nearly 12 million jobs created after the recession, more than 8 million went to those with a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to the georgetown center on education and the workforce. \u201cblue-collar workers may want a union, but fear defines union election to a troubling degree,\u201d harley shaiken, a labor expert at the university of california, berkeley, told me. \u201cyou have the same fear among white-collar workers, but they know they have other options. if they lose their job, they\u2019ll have something two days later. that could give them more confidence about turning towards a union.\u201d  this difference in who is joining unions could create further bifurcation in the economy, as workers who are already relatively stable become even more protected by unions, while workers who feel themselves in a tenuous position have fewer places to turn for problems like wage and hour violations, sexual-harassment claims, or unfair termination. union employees are also better positioned to negotiate wage increases than non-union employees\u2014non-union employees make 80 percent of what union employees do,  according to  the bureau of labor statistics.  lowell peterson, the executive director of the writers guild, east, who has organized both blue-collar and white-collar workers in his career, said that organizing skilled workers might be easier in today\u2019s economic climate. \u201cif you\u2019re a semiskilled or unskilled worker, your leverage is a little different,\u201d he told me. skilled employees are hard for employers to replace, and they know it, he said. while employers think they\u2019ll be able to hire another worker off the street to stock shelves for amazon or work on a car assembly line, they worry about being able to find enough skilled and educated workers to do the white-collar jobs they\u2019re trying to fill. \u201c[managers in media] can\u2019t just say, i don\u2019t care who does this job, as long as someone does it,\u201d peterson said.  white-collar workers may also have an easier time doing the work to organize a union. many  gothamist  workers were young and didn\u2019t have children, so were able to go to meetings after work, scott heins, 29, who worked full-time as a photographer and reporter for  gothamist  for two years and was on the  gothamist  organizing committee, told me. blue-collar workers are often older, and have families to support. and, since white-collar employees don\u2019t work on the factory floor all day, they are less physically exhausted at the end of the day. additionally, the access to information technology that white-collar workers have can make it easier to communicate with other employees throughout the company.  of course, white-collar workers still risk losing their jobs if a union forms\u2014that\u2019s what seems to have happened to 115 employees of  dnainfo  and  gothamist , two websites owned by joe ricketts, a billionaire who founded td ameritrade, after 25 new york staff members  voted  to join the writers guild of america, east. but many of those employees have since found other jobs, and peterson told me that the people who lost their jobs didn\u2019t regret organizing. heins told me that\u2019s how he feels. \u201cif forced into the same situation, i would do the same thing again,\u201d he said. heins said he and others knew the risks when they organized, especially when ricketts, who is vocally anti-union, purchased  gothamist .  but heins also landed on his feet. he is now working as a freelance photographer in new york, and said that it was going pretty well, in part because of support from groups like the economic hardship reporting project, which established a $5,000  fund  to help laid-off reporters from  gothamist  and  dnainfo . \u201ci am very fortunate in that photography lends itself well to freelancing,\u201d he told me.  in contrast to heins\u2019 ability to find work after losing his job, many blue-collar workers can\u2019t afford to risk such a change. they are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck, and tend to have less savings because their salaries are lower in the first place. \u201cpeople were really terrified that they were going to lose their job,\u201d robert hathorn, a pro-union worker at nissan in mississippi, told the  website  labor notes   in the aftermath of the uaw\u2019s organizing loss in august. \u00a0  part of the divergence between white- and blue-collar workers may also have to do with where union drives are taking place. many white-collar workers live in big cities like new york and los angeles, where workers are likely to be more liberal and supportive of unions than in other places, and where owners (with obvious  exceptions ) may be less likely to embark on anti-union campaigns because of public pressure. but increasingly, manufacturing and production jobs are located in the south, where anti-union attitudes are most persistent. boeing located its dreamliner aircraft assembly line in south carolina rather than washington state to reduce the leverage of the machinists\u2019 union, analysts  told   the new york times . and the failure of the united auto workers to organize plants in mississippi and tennessee was closely related to anti-union attitudes there, as i found in  previous reporting , attitudes that are less prevalent in automakers\u2019 home turf of michigan and ohio. \u00a0  educated workers weren\u2019t always as open to organizing campaigns. in the past, educated workers eschewed unions for two main reasons: they had negative opinions about unions, and they felt that they had enough of a voice in their jobs that they didn\u2019t need union representation. both of those factors have changed in the millennial generation, according to ruth milkman, a professor of sociology at the city university of new york graduate center. today, 45 percent of millennials think labor unions have a positive impact on the country, up from 32 percent in 2010, according to  the pew  research center. that\u2019s partly because millennials are much  more progressive  than previous generations.  the current climate for media jobs may also be motivating some of the media-unionization drives, she said. while college-educated millennials know that they can get all sorts of jobs in today\u2019s booming economy, they are disappointed with the quality of the jobs in the media sector. \u201cthese are people who were led to expect that if they did their part, the world would be handed to them on a silver platter,\u201d she told me. \u201cand then they find that these are crummy jobs.\u201d  of course, thousands of blue-collar workers are also finding that the jobs available to them in today\u2019s economy are crummy as well. but for them, the alternative to a crummy job\u2014nothing\u2014is even more terrifying.

tobacco moment, not  just here , but around the world.  urbanization, falling poverty rates, and growing global trade  have changed  the diets and expanded the waistlines of the world\u2019s poor, with processed food and sweetened drinks becoming household staples. even very low-income communities are seeing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease as a result. but many countries lack the tax revenue and medical infrastructure to treat such conditions, leading to a burgeoning global-health crisis. to tackle it, a new task force of well-known academics and advocates is encouraging developing nations to treat candy and soft drinks as many of them treat alcohol and cigarettes\u2014and to tax them.  the idea might seem counterproductive, or even cruel. cheap calories have contributed to  falling rates  of undernourishment and a reduced incidence of famine. taxes increase costs, with a burden that falls most heavily on the most poor. and the relationship between added sugar and worse health is not a  clear-as-day causal one . but promoting empty calories might be crueler, experts argue. \u201cpeople say these taxes are regressive,\u201d lawrence summers, a leader of the task force and a former treasury secretary, told me. \u201cbut i say premature death is regressive.\u201d  summers is co-chairing the new coalition along with michael bloomberg, the former mayor of new york city and the current world health organization ambassador for noncommunicable diseases, an honorary position. joining summers and bloomberg are, among others, tabar\u00e9 v\u00e1zquez, the president of uruguay, margaret chan, the former director-general of the world health organization (who), and nicola sturgeon, the first minister of scotland. the group of politicians, health experts, and economists plans to study fiscal measures that can improve public health and to urge lower-income countries to adopt them.  its creation comes as international organizations and individual governments are increasingly worried about the prevalence and cost of lifestyle diseases. the rate of  obesity has tripled in lower-income countries  that have adopted western diets and lifestyles, with doctors warning that the threat of diabetes has become pandemic. there are immense costs in terms of human suffering. and there are immense costs in terms of lost productivity, lost wages, increased health expenditures, and a smaller labor force. five main noncommunicable medical conditions\u2014cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and mental-health conditions\u2014are  estimated to cost  china $27.8 trillion between 2012 and 2030, and india $6.2 trillion. the price tags will be in the millions and billions for many poorer countries as well.  \u201cthere\u2019s a set of lower-income countries, like bangladesh and ethiopia and myanmar, that will go in the span of 40 years from basically having no burden of noncommunicable diseases to having a similar burden as the united states or the united kingdom. that\u2019s three or four times as fast as high-income countries had to make that epidemiological transition,\u201d said thomas bollyky, a global health expert at the council on foreign relations, the new york\u2013based think tank. \u201cif you can\u2019t slow this down and give countries time to adapt, they\u2019re dealing with a problem coming four times as fast with a quarter of the resources.\u201d  some noncommunicable conditions might best be targeted with low-cost medical interventions: vaccines for hpv and hepatitis, inexpensive medicines for people with hypertension. for others, taxes might be part of the answer. \u201cfor the first time in the history of the world, more people are having their health affected by eating too much, rather that too little. that\u2019s a sea change for humanity,\u201d summers said, adding, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a while before the developing world is able to afford open-heart surgery on a massive scale. fiscal measures are super-efficacious, both because prices matter particularly for younger and poorer people and because taxes are educative.\u201d  taxes do have a clear record of curbing the consumption of, and thus the public-health impact of, tobacco and alcohol. the who estimates that  raising excise taxes  on cigarettes by $1 per pack would push up the cost of cigarettes by an average of 63 percent in low-income countries. after such an increase, projections indicate, the prevalence of daily cigarette smoking among adults would fall from 14.1 percent to 12.9 percent, leading to 15 million fewer smoking-attributable deaths. the group argues that \u201ctobacco-tax increases are the single most effective policy to reduce tobacco use.\u201d  studies are similarly clear about the effect of alcohol taxes, if fewer countries have them as an explicit public-health policy. \u201cnearly all studies, including those with different study designs, found that there was an inverse relationship between the tax or price of alcohol and indices of excessive drinking or alcohol-related health outcomes,\u201d one survey published in the  american journal of preventive medicine   found . making alcohol more expensive does not just cut down on rates of cirrhosis and cancer, researchers  have learned , but also reduces the incidence\u00a0 of car crashes, suicides, domestic violence, workplace accidents, house fires, and so on. at the same time as these kinds of vice taxes reduce the consumption of dangerous products, they boost government coffers\u2014providing a potential revenue stream for health spending.  then there is sugar. \u201csugar is where tobacco was in 1972,\u201d summers told me. \u201cthe equivalent of the surgeon general\u2019s report has been written, but there has not been much that has happened yet to reduce demand.\u201d he was gesturing to a growing body of studies showing that taxing sugar leads to reduced consumption\u2014with a potential knock-on effect on obesity rates and health expenditures. perhaps the best evidence comes from mexico, which instituted a one-peso tax on every liter of sugar-sweetened beverages back in 2014,  leading to  a 5.5 percent drop in consumption in the first year and 9.7 percent in the second year. \u00a0  \u201cthese taxes help, and the people who consume the most are most affected,\u201d said barry popkin, an economist and nutrition expert at the university of north carolina, who studied the effect of the sugar tax in mexico. he said that while the burden of the tax might have hit lower-income people the hardest, the benefits might help them the most, too. \u201cthe poor do pay more, but they\u2019re the ones who can\u2019t afford health care. they\u2019re not being treated much at all in terms of chronic disease\u2014diabetes is not something you can treat cheaply.\u201d he added that the study did not show that mexicans facing higher prices for soda and sports drinks seemed to shift their calories into other kinds of junk food.  still, not all research shows such promising results\u2014nor is it clear that sugar taxes will lead to less consumption, and thus to lower rates of obesity, and thus to a lower incidence of noncommunicable disease, and thus to reduced long-term public-health spending, in part because such tax initiatives have not been around long enough to know. \u201cstudies looking at the effect of actual soda taxes implemented at the state level find that, while the taxes do lead to a moderate decrease in soda consumption, the net effect on obesity is next to zero,\u201d reads one review of  the literature  in the united states.  moreover, critics have questioned whether such policies are fair\u2014pumping up prices for the poor with a questionable benefit for public health. others oppose them on the grounds that they are paternalistic and interfere with free markets. \u201cindividuals\u2019 decisions about what risks they are willing to take and how much they are willing to trade pleasure for diminished health are incredibly personal and should not be overly politicized,\u201d argues peter van dorn of the cato institute, the libertarian  think tank . plus, junk-food and soda taxes are often unpopular, raising the ire of grocery stores and food producers, along with citizens themselves.  in spite of all that, many countries have moved in recent years to use taxes to try to improve their citizens\u2019 diets and cut down on health costs. thailand  recently instituted  a tax on sugary beverages, with hungary putting one on  junk food  and vanuatu putting in place significant  import restrictions . that should provide more data on the efficacy of such measures, and the best way to design them.  if they work, the impact on public health could be considerable, in terms of lower costs and higher revenue. \u201cyou\u2019re also seeing massive demographic changes in these countries,\u201d bollyky said. \u201cit isn\u2019t that people in developing countries have grown fat and lazy and intemperate in their habits, and now they have these health conditions. it\u2019s because of fairly dramatic shifts in their populations as well as in lifestyles, and their health systems need time to accommodate them. they\u2019re having to do it faster than we did and with fewer resources.\u201d  the united states might stand to implement more vice taxes too, summers added. \u201cthis is some of the lowest-hanging fruit for potential policy

mulvaney vowed to only pursue lawsuits if evidence of \u201cquantifiable and unavoidable harm\u201d is found. and the agency will rely more heavily on its rulemaking efforts as the engine of change, instead of enforcement, meaning that the bureau won\u2019t focus on fines or lawsuits to cull bad behavior. instead, the cfpb will primarily look to the creation and implementation of new rules, in hopes of changing dangerous practices\u2014a process that is less punitive and more time-consuming.  this memo is in line with the plan that mulvaney has already started enacting. in the nearly two months that mulvaney has been at the helm of the bureau, he has  instituted policies  that have pulled back on the agency\u2019s rulemaking, enforcement, and collection of personal data. according to nick bourke, the director of the consumer-finance project at the pew charitable trusts, this strikes at some of the key areas of success for the bureau. \u201cenforcement has been the biggest impact the cfpb has had so far,\u201d bourke told me during an interview in november. and thus far, the implementations of new rules for prepaid cards, payday lenders, and mandatory arbitration clauses\u2014all considered big victories for the bureau\u2014have been slowed or killed since mulvaney took on leadership of the bureau.  the process of paring back the scope of the bureau\u2019s enforcement efforts is already underway, and already questions have been raised about mulvaney\u2019s close relationships with some of the entities that he is now in charge of regulating. on monday, mulvaney shuttered an  investigation of world acceptance corporation , a small-dollar loan operation from his home state of south carolina that contributed an  estimated $4,500  to his political campaigns over a three-year period. earlier this month, mulvaney  dropped a lawsuit  against a group of payday lenders in kansas accused of misleading customers and charging interest as high as 950 percent. campaign  donation records  show between 2012 and 2016, mulvaney received contributions totaling more than $60,000 from groups in the payday-lending industry.  this new trajectory of the agency will almost certainly ruffle longtime advocates of the bureau and supporters of its work under cordray. many have feared that mulvaney, who has been a  vocal critic  of the cfpb, would shut down the agency, or, short of that, gut it from the inside. tuesday\u2019s memo didn\u2019t exactly assuage those concerns. \u201cwhen i arrived at the cfpb, i told folks that despite what they might have heard, i had no intention of shutting down the bureau,\u201d mulvaney writes. \u201cindeed, the law doesn\u2019t allow that.\u201d  in january, the acting director asked the federal reserve to refrain from giving the agency  any money  for the second quarter of 2018, saying that instead, the bureau could use some of the $177 million reserve fund accrued during cordray\u2019s tenure to operate. \u201cthe request\u2014or lack thereof\u2014will serve to reduce the federal deficit by the amount that the bureau might have requested under different leadership,\u201d mulvaney wrote.  with a new mission for the bureau articulated, mulvaney has cemented the trump administration\u2019s vision of the cfpb: a smaller, quieter, and less active financial regulator\u2014one that looks a lot more like the regulators of the pre-recession era.

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/avoAUWcwcrs", "pub_datetime": "2018-01-24 14:38:53", "summary": " toys \u201cr\u201d us announced on wednesday that it will close  about 180 stores  in the u.s., or about one-fifth of its domestic locations, as the company emerges from bankruptcy proceedings to restructure $5 billion in debt.  on one level, this is just the latest chapter in the never-ending saga of brick-and-mortar calamity as the retail industry focuses more on online sales. the first half of 2017 was among the  worst periods for retail stores on record , and the pain isn\u2019t nearly over. in the last four months, sears and kmart have  announced  63 imminent store closings (after shuttering 350 locations in 2017), gap  announced  plans to close 200 locations in the next three years, and walmart  announced  that it would close 63 sam\u2019s club stores and lay off thousands of workers.  but while toys \u201cr\u201d us has suffered from some predictable brick-and-mortar burdens, its story is a complicated one that touches on family economics, modern leisure, and private-equity mismanagement. there are the three main culprits of the sad demise of america\u2019s erstwhile titan of toys.   1. it\u2019s the e-retailers.   this story begins\u2014as all modern retail stories must\u2014with amazon. the \u201ceverything store\u201d sells toys now\u2014billions of dollars of toys, in fact. between 2015 and 2017, amazon toy sales grew 24 percent, to $4 billion. toys \u201cr\u201d us, whose revenue  declined  in those years by a similar sum, simply doesn\u2019t have the same facility with digital shoppers. last june,  the company\u2019s ceo  criticized the store\u2019s own website, including its  kludgy baby-gift registry tool , acknowledging that the store had simply fallen behind contemporary shopping habits.  failing to build an online presence is bad for any retailer, but it\u2019s particularly deleterious for one whose core demographic includes parents short on time and cash. as my colleague rebecca rosen  wrote  last year, most households  don\u2019t have a stay-at-home parent anymore , which makes shopping excursions a luxury many families cannot afford. so more moms and dads are skipping the car trips and buying toys from a website they can trust.   2. it\u2019s the debt, too.   it\u2019s a mistake to consider toys \u201cr\u201d us nothing more than sears, but for kids. yes, the store was clearly hurt by the rise of amazon and other large retailers; walmart actually overtook it as the nation\u2019s largest toy retailer all the way back in 1998.  but its collapse has been especially acute, due to terrible mismanagement by private-equity firms. after toys \u201cr\u201d us was taken private by kkr, bain, and vornado in 2005, it took on a lot of debt, leaving the company with repayments that have crippled it in a period of declining sales. toys \u201cr\u201d us has spent  more than $250 million  annually to pay back $5 billion in long-term debt. these repayments became unsustainable once revenue started to decline consistently, as it has each year since 2012. that left one option: for the company to declare bankruptcy and renegotiate the terms of its debt.   3. blame the kids and their screens.   it would be satisfying to exclusively blame private-equity sharks and retail conglomerates for the fall of toys \u201cr\u201d us. but there\u2019s another group that deserves consideration as a culprit: kids.  today\u2019s teenagers and children have been shaped by smartphones, social-media apps, and living-room bingeing, as the psychologist jean twenge  wrote  in  the atlantic  last year. this has coincided with a sharp rise in teen depression and suicide. less gravely, it\u2019s also depleted the marketplace for hardware toys. in the last year, lego, mattel, and hasbro  have all reported  declining sales for key brands (like american girl or   star wars  merchandise ). maybe tactile trinkets have simply lost their luster among kids.  or maybe kids don\u2019t even know which toys are out there. last year,  the wall street journal   reported  that with millennials watching far less cable television than they used to, young parents and their children simply aren\u2019t seeing the commercials that toy makers rely on to market new products. as a result, much of toys \u201cr\u201d us\u2019s merchandise is doubly cursed\u2014kids can\u2019t play with it on their screens, and parents won\u2019t find out about it on their screens.  while bankruptcy might seem like corporate death, the truth is that toys \u201cr\u201d us is far from defunct. with  $11.5 billion in 2017 sales , its toy business is still more than twice as big as amazon\u2019s. but in the last decade, it has faced a brutal set of economic and technological forces that has left it heavy in debt and light in new customers. along with every other struggling brick-and-mortar company today, the scariest question is this: if toys \u201cr\u201d us can\u2019t cut it with 4 percent unemployment nine years into a recovery, what happens when the recession comes?

(see chart below). this yoy increase was the highest \u201con record\u201d though data are only available back to 2006.  on a monthly basis the ahe of supervisory employees jumped by 0.8% (seasonally adjusted) in january and 0.5% in december, resulting in annualized growth over this two month period of 8.0%.        click on graph for larger image.     prior to 2010 the bls only reported average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers in its monthly release.  since then it has become apparent that the ahe\u2019s of supervisory workers are much more volatile than the ahe\u2019s of production/non-supervisory employees (the standard deviation of monthly % changes in the former is more than twice as high as the latter).  moreover, \u201coutsized\u201d (significantly above trend) gains in the ahe\u2019s of supervisory workers have tended to be followed by below-trend increases over the subsequent two months.  if history is any guide, that will be the case in the next two monthly reports.  supervisory workers accounted for about 17.6% of total non-farm payroll workers in january, so if the ahe of supervisory workers were unchanged from january to march (which would imply annualized growth of 3.9% over the four-month period ending in march), and the ahe of production/non-supervisory workers increased at an annualized pace of 2.5% over the next two months (slightly above the recent trend), then the yoy increase in the ahe for all non-farm payroll employees would decline to 2.7% in march from the \u201cscary\u201d 2.9% in january.  (february is likely to see a year over year increase of about 2.7% as well).  inquiring minds might like to know why i spent so much time on why the yoy increase in the ahe in january increased slightly to 2.9%.  the reason is that so many \u201ctalking heads\u201d have been citing the january \u201cwage report\u201d as one of the major catalysts for the recent turmoil in the stock market.  that, of course, seem inane, but it was so widely cited that it got me looking into this.

( [1] )    new google ai incubator: \"investment arm aimed squarely on artificial intelligence  will operate almost like an incubator with a shared workspace for ai startups and mentorship\" ( [1]   [2] )    lots of good labeled data (reliable ground truth) is the key to success with ai ( [1]   [2]   [3]   [4] )    ai in the real world is a lot harder than ideal conditions in part because you see crazy things like robots getting attacked by humans ( [1]   [2] )    \"the google [chrome] ad-blocker will block all advertising on sites that have a certain number of unacceptable ads, according to the wall street journal. that includes ads that have pop-ups, auto-playing video, and prestitial count-down ads that delay the display of content.\" ( [1] )     nice acm queue article from google sres on availability as a combination of subservice reliability, rapid recovery, and setting expectations ( [1] )    \"designing a [software] library to reduce cognitive load is still the exception, not the rule\" ( [1]   [2] )     a lesson for bigger companies, investing in the long-term with your researchers, who are often working a few years ahead of what youll need now ( [1] )     wow: \"the melt\u2019s blundering trajectory is instructive  entrepreneurs frequently embark on these missions with vast sums of money and a deep belief in technology\u2019s power to solve all problems\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is not always a formula for success . they were all good people, and they all wanted good things. they just didn\u2019t know anything about running restaurants.\" ( [1] )    \"the once-hot social network was built on the idea that people would enjoy having anonymous conversations with people close by. that\u2019s a fantastic concept until you remember that anonymous internet person and by definition near you are scary as hell in practice.\" ( [1] )    great teardown of the juicero, includes some excellent business advice on iterative development and testing your ideas on real customers ( [1]   [2] )    \"when the us government discovers a vulnerability   it can keep it secret and use it offensively  or it can alert the software vendor and see that the vulnerability is patched, protecting the country  every offensive weapon is a (potential) chink in our defense.\" ( [1] )    on spearfishing attacks: \"by a careful design and timing of a message, it should be possible to make virtually any person click\" ( [1]   [2] )    schneier on forging voices: \"i dont think were ready for this. we use peoples voices to authenticate them all the time, in all sorts of different ways.\"\ufeff ( [1] )    facebook says, \"we have had to expand our security focus to include more subtle and insidious forms of misuse, including attempts to manipulate civic discourse and deceive people\" ( [1]   [2] )    remarkable and concerning that this is possible: \"by accessing accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, the web-hosted javascript measures subtle changes in a phones angle, rotation, movement speed, and similar characteristics. the data, in turn, can reveal sensitive information about the phone and its user  [including] the keystrokes being entered\" ( [1] )    nice high level description here of the difference between what apple and google are doing for privacy-preserving machine learning. in brief, apple adds noise to the data to preserve privacy, but google learns on the device then sends the updates to the machine learned models back (much like parameters servers in deep learning). the truth is theyre probably both doing both, but its still a good thing to think about. ( [1] )    using battery backup to optimize gas power plants by being able to skip the expensive bits for gas turbines, sitting in standby because of lengthy startup times. its easy and practical, a nice example of low hanging fruit with major impact. ( [1] )     good data on the projected costs of energy sources ( [1] )    good data on the newspaper industry. theres a curious spike in ad revenue from 1980-2000 that isnt matched by subscriptions. ( [1] )    jeff bezos is making journalism profitable: \"the post has said that it was profitable last year \u2014 and not through cost-cutting  the post has gone on a hiring spree. it has hired hundreds of reporters and editors and has more than tripled its technology staff  third straight year of double-digit revenue growth  you have to be great at technology. you have to be great at monetization. but one thing i think we\u2019re proving is that if you are, great journalism can be profitable.\" ( [1] )    how google took over the classroom, great article, but misses that the failure of ipads was a big piece of this ( [1]   [2] )    duolingos excellent efforts to help people learn english, which can be a tool for economic or educational advancement ( [1] )    amazon web services cuts prices again, remarkable ( [1] )    almost all cloud workloads right now are not cloud optimized, so the customers mostly moved a system built for fixed hardware resources to the cloud and then run idle a lot rather than redesigning to optimize with dynamically scaling ( [1] )    latest version of google earth is impressive, definitely worth trying ( [1] )    brent smith and i received the first ever ieee internet computing test of time award for our 2003 paper on amazons recommender system. in a new article for the ieee internet computing 20th anniversary issue, we look back at the last two decades. ( [1] )    a virtual reality game that succeeds at taking advantage of what it can do well and what it cant to create a fully immersive experience ( [1] )     somehow, i missed that chris sacca is retiring. amazing career and influence he had, and impressive to decide to go an entire new direction now. ( [1] )    in a stack overflow survey, what software engineers care about, its who they work with, what they are doing, and what they learn far more than salary. in the top five items, three are about who you work with and what you learn, one is benefits, and one is commute. but the benefits are complicated -- its not salary, stock, and bonus -- but the top items all things related to work environment and commute, vacation, and health care. ( [1] )    great interview with the ceo of coursera: \"humility and the ability to listen well are the big things i look for  if you want to understand people, you need to hear them  [also have] ambitious goals to lift the organization up and everybody with it. setting goals that are ambitious but also achievable is an important skill.\" ( [1] )    great quote from jeff: \"at amazon, weve had a lot of inventions that we were very excited about, and customers didnt care at all. and believe me, those inventions were not disruptive in any way. the only thing thats disruptive is customer adoption.\" ( [1] )    nice line in dan arielys book payoff: \"if you really want to demotivate people, shredding their work is the way to go, but  you can get almost all the way there simply by ignoring their efforts.\" ( [1] )    xkcd points out minor changes in methodology yield radical changes in data visualizations of most unusually popular activity in a location ( [1] )    xkcd on machine learning, disturbingly close to reality ( [1] )    xkcd on hard problems ( [1] )    xkcd on survivorship bias ( [1] )    xkcd on unhelpful code reviews ( [1] )    very funny that burger king ran an ad with \"ok, google\" and it works. once again xkcd was hilariously prescient about this. ( [1]   [2] )    smbc comic on bayesian inference: \"given his low priors\" ( [1] )    smbc comic: \"then it occurred to me, hey, ive got like a sample size of one here, and its not double blind.\" ( [1] )    smbc comic on behavioral economics ( [1] )    smbc comic: \"wait, are you going to turn my lifes work into a joke about butts or something?\"  [1] )    ", "kwds": ["some", "of", "the",

( [1]   [2]   [3] )    artificial intelligence expert yann lecun says, \"there have been, on the face of it, impressive demonstrations, [but] those are not as impressive as they look  they dont have common sense  one of the things we really want to do is get machines to acquire the very large number of facts that represent the constraints of the real world just by observing it through video or other channels. that\u2019s what would allow them to acquire common sense, in the end.\" ( [1] )     genetic algorithms and neural networks are back. it feels like the 1990s all over again. ( [1] )     bringing more novices to ai now is the way to get more experts and advances later ( [1] )    nice results from focusing on errors that matter to people, the perceived quality of the system by humans, not theoretical accuracy ( [1]   [2] )     success often comes from trying many things: \"start  with a hazy intuition or vision  after a lot of trial and error they get closer and closer to discovering what their idea is  seeking novelty instead of objectives is risky \u2014 not every interesting thread will pay off \u2014 but  the potential payoffs are higher.\" ( [1] )    research includes people able to do things no one else can, including having data or compute at the frontier beyond what anyone else has done before ( [1]   [2] )    6.3m virtual reality headsets sold in 2016, but almost all so far just the cheap toys where you slot your smartphone in to use as the screen ( [1]   [2] )    \"total [tablet] sales sinking 15.6%, year on year, with sales of 174.8m units in 2016 compared to 2015s 207.2m\" ( [1] )    for the first time, more people in the us using netflix than a dvr: \"54 percent of us adults reporting they have netflix in their households compared to the 53 percent of us adults that have dvr\" ( [1] )      the economist: \"amazon\u2019s heady valuation resembles a self-fulfilling prophecy. the company will be able to keep spending, and its spending will keep making it more powerful\" ( [1] )    \"what has surprised aws as the cloud has evolved  i don\u2019t think in our wildest dreams we ever thought we\u2019d have a six- to seven-year head start\" ( [1] )     and that is true in retail for amazon as well ( [1]   [2]   [3] )     \"yahoo is perhaps most famous for destroying all of its best social properties. from its hideous deformations of flickr and neglect of upcoming to its starvation of delicious and torment of geocities users, the company excelled at buying great things and turning them into unusable parodies of themselves. execs seemed to profoundly misunderstand why people used the sites they bought.\" ( [1] )    \"google will account for 78 percent of search ad revenue in 2017, while facebook will get 39 percent of display ad revenue. everyone else  is fighting over the scraps.\" ( [1] )    culture is created by what you publicly reward, not what you say ( [1]   [2]   [3] )    \"the problem with bad processes is that they institutionalize inefficiency. they ensure that things will be done the wrong way, over and over and over again\" ( [1]   [2] )    \"burnout begins when a worker feels overwhelmed for a sustained period of time, then apathetic and ultimately numb . workers who used to take the lead on projects grow taciturn during meetings. top performers start coming in late, leaving early and watch their careers stall  burnout is claiming victims at work, and companies aren\u2019t ready to cope\" ( [1] )    a lot of companies have merely medium data, not big data: \"hundreds of enterprises were hugely disappointed by their useless 2 to 10tb hadoop clusters  their data works better in other technologies\" ( [1] )    lack of incentives leads to poor internet of things security ( [1] )    as javascript ages, it repeats many of the problems of the past: \"using data from over 133k websites, we show that 37% of them include at least one library with a known vulnerability\" ( [1] )    \"what are some things you wish you knew when you started programming?\" ( [1]   [2] )     many xkcd comics are both funny and prescient, and this one on encryption seems particularly relevant right now ( [1] )    xkcd comic on friends that have an amazon echo ( [1] )    smbc comic on \"existential sort\". dont miss the hovertext: \"also, any list can be immediately sorted by just pretty much being

others manage people.    id summarize it by saying it takes a teaching and mentoring approach to management, very much of the school that managers primarily exist to help the people on their team. the advice is both practical and actionable, with specific advice for running 1:1s and meetings, and focused how to encourage conversations where people strive to improve themselves as well as helping others.    some carefully selected quotes from the book:    \"it seems obvious that good bosses must care personally about the people who report directly to them  and yet  \"    \"it turns out that when people trust you and believe you care about them, they are much more likely to accept and act on your praise and criticism, tell you what they really think about what you are doing well and, more importantly, not doing so well, engage in this same behavior with one another  embrace their role on the team, and focus on getting results\"    \"when youre the boss, its awkward to ask your direct reports to tell you frankly what they think of your performance, even more awkward for them than it is for you. to help, i [ask]  is there anything i could do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?  it is essential that you  commit to sticking with the conversation until you have a genuine response. one technique is to count to six before saying anything else, forcing them to endure the silence. the goal is not to bully but to insist on a candid discussion  then listen with the intent to understand  once youve asked your question and embraced the discomfort and understood the criticism, you have to follow up by showing that you welcome it. you have to reward the candor if you want to get more of it  make a chance as soon as possible  show youre trying.\"    \"if you can absorb the blows, the members of your team are more likely to be good bosses to their employees when they have them  the rewards of watching people you care about flourish and then help others flourish.\"    \"the ultimate goal of radical candor is to achieve results collaboratively that you could never achieve individually  a culture of guidance  an exemplary team  self-correcting quality whereby most problems are solved before you are even aware of them  dont start by bossing people. theyll just hate you. start by listening to them.\"\ufeff   ", "kwds": ["div", "class=\"separator",

( [1]   [2] )       not sure how well known this is: \"facebook collects information about pages [you] visit that contain facebook sharing buttons  and in case that wasn\u2019t enough, facebook also buys data about its users\u2019 mortgages, car ownership and shopping habits from some of the biggest commercial data brokers. facebook uses all this data to offer marketers a chance to target ads to increasingly specific groups of people. indeed, we found facebook offers advertisers more than 1,300 categories for ad targeting \u2014 everything from people whose property size is less than .26 acres to households with exactly seven credit cards.\" ( [1] )       interesting example for the news industry: \"doubling down on traditional journalism and investing heavily in new ways to deliver it, through smartphone apps, voice-activated speakers and e-readers. the post\u2019s digital effort has become the envy of the industry, with as many as 80 software engineers, developers and others working alongside reporters and editors to present the news in real time.\" ( [1] )       \"bezos has worked to create a culture at amazon that\u2019s hospitable to experimentation  developing products customers will actually want to pay for  experiments start small and grow over time  a small team to experiment with the idea and find out if it\u2019s viable  if a team succeeds in smaller challenges, it\u2019s given more resources and a larger challenge to tackle  prioritize launching early over everything else  learn as quickly as possible whether an idea that sounds good on paper is actually a good idea in the real world  getting a product into the hands of paying customers as quickly as possible and taking their feedback seriously  avoids wasting years working on products that don\u2019t serve the needs of real customers.\" ( [1] )       new direction for the cloud, just small pieces of code running somewhere (you dont care where) and data stored somewhere (you dont care where), all auto scaled ( [1]   [2] )        \"many failed ideas have been resuscitated and rebranded as successful products and services, owned and managed by people other than their originators. behind almost every popular app or website today lie numerous shadow versions that have been sloughed away by time. yet recognition of the group nature of the enterprise would undermine a myth that legitimizes the consolidation of profit, for the most part, among a small group of people.\" ( [1] )      for those of us tracking virtual reality: \"while facebook does not provide sales figures for the $599 oculus rift headset  analysts believe they are slow. one research firm  estimated the company sold only about 355,000 by the end of last year.\"\ufeff ( [1]   [2]   [3] )      a surprising level of detail here on what software development is like inside of google. i agree with most of it, and highly recommend reading at least section 2. ( [1]   [2] )       great blog post summarizing nips 2016. highlights are what wins kaggle competitions, why deep learning works, latest twiddles to deep learning and reinforcement learning, why dialogs (chat) still doesnt work, and that baidu has products whos only value is in the data they collect (not direct revenue, just the explore part of explore/exploit, learning how to be more effective). ( [1] )       ease of use is badly underrated: \"using tensorflow makes me feel like i\u2019m not smart enough to use tensorflow; whereas using keras makes me feel like neural networks are easier than i realized.\" ( [1] )       new paper by geoff hinton and jeff dean, essentially a very large ensemble of neural networks with sparsity enforced to minimize the computational cost ( [1] )       thoughtful comments on engineering management ( [1] )       different people we work with in tech tend to have different ideas of what it means to get things done ( [1] )       \"people with different backgrounds bring new information. simply interacting with individuals who are different forces group members to prepare better, to anticipate alternative viewpoints and to expect that reaching consensus will take effort.\" ( [1] )       meetings are expensive -- a 10 person meeting for an hour costs a few thousand dollars -- and people hate meetings too. some good reoccurring themes here are to keep meetings small, short, write a tight agenda ahead of time, stay off your laptop and phone, and try to finish early. ( [1] )       disappointing game theory tidbit of the day, the joy of destruction game shows people enjoy causing harm when they can do it without consequences ( [1]   [2] )        great data visualizations from 538, not just eye candy but convey information quickly ( [1] )         \"tesla has 1.3 billion miles of car-driving data thanks to its autopilot-equipped vehicles that are already on the road before competitors in detroit and silicon valley can roll self-driving cars off the lot. it\u2019s a massive competitive advantage.\" ( [1] )       fun details on laying undersea internet

far side of the moon and on mars in the next four years ( [1] )       for those interested in education, mits popular and excellent scratch has published a dataset of how people learn computational thinking ( [1] )       what code.org has achieved is very impressive: \"trained 50,000 new k-12 computer science teachers  more than 20 million lines of code have been written by  more than one

( [1] )    on building products: \"keep it extremely simple, or two thirds of the population can\u2019t use your design\" ( [1]   [2] )    \"the problem isnt the users: its that weve designed our computer systems security so badly that we demand the user do all of these counterintuitive things.\" ( [1] )    fun ai experiments from google. dont miss \"quick, draw!\" ( [1] )    interesting new phone design, screen taking up the entire front: \"hands down, the best looking smartphone ever\" ( [1] )    great article on netflix recommendations, tidbits on the importance of reacting immediately to new data, using immediate intent, freshness (esp. new releases), and perceived quality (difference between online evaluation and offline). ( [1] )    opinionated summary of recsys 2016, and also somewhat of a summary of recommendations and personalization research as of 2016 ( [1]   [2] )    xavier amatriain on lessons learned from building recommender systems ( [1] )    youtube is now using deep learning for recommendations, more than just embeddings, includes a ranker with heavily engineered features ( [1] )    ex-facebook employee: \"news feed optimizes for engagement. as weve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.\" ( [1] )    pfeffer: \"you need to be careful with what you measure, because you are going to get it, and often you don\u2019t really want it.\" ( [1]   [2] )    obama: \"traditionally, when we think about security and protecting ourselves, we think in terms of armor or walls. increasingly, i find myself looking to medicine and thinking about viruses, antibodies.\"\ufeff ( [1] )    surprising, just set up a hotspot, and the interference from peoples fingers moving in the wifi signal is enough to catch most of the passwords anyone enters while connected ( [1]   [2] )    \"an entire company\u2019s product line has just been turned into a botnet that is now attacking the united states\" ( [1]   [2] )    bit.ly short urls hid malicious content that was then used to get at colin powells e-mail ( [1] )    carefully picked textures on eyeglass frames to fool face recognition, pictures in the paper are amusing ( [1]   [2] )     ai guru andrew ng: \"were lucky the ai community is very open, and top researchers freely share many ideas and even code. this helps the whole field progress. hope we can keep it that way.\" ( [1]   [2] )    love this: \"being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research\" ( [1] )    two new massive labeled open data sets from google, one for images, one for videos ( [1]   [2] )    \"translations that are vastly improved compared to the previous phrase-based production system. gnmt reduces translation errors by more than 55%-85% on several major language pairs\" ( [1] )    google ceo sundar pichai: \"our goal is build a personal google for each and every user.\" ( [1] )      i got a mention in the guardian for some of my past work: \"greg linden may not be a household name\" ( [1] )     data on what amazon echo is actually used for. mostly playing a song, it appears.\ufeff ( [1] )    like at the last dot-com boom, there are a bunch of delivery services cropping up with models that dont seem like theyre likely to be profitable. uber, which  was in a better position than most to do this profitably, just shut their food delivery service down, which doesnt bode well for the others. ( [1] )    current state of virtual reality: \"none of these uses are particularly compelling right now, especially given the cost of buying a vr headset. this may change in the future.\" ( [1] )    \"giving employees hours, days or even months in which to work without close scrutiny has enhanced productivity instead of harming it\"\ufeff ( [1] )    t-mobiles ceo on leadership: \"listen to your employees, listen to your customers, shut the f*** up, and do what they tell you\" ( [1] )    smbc comic on survivorship bias ( [1] )    smbc comic on work, dark but funny: \"the important thing is to find the low low bar that works for you.\" ( [1] )    smbc comic on eliminating security risks ( [1] )    smbc comic being a scientist. dont miss the mouseover: \"hopefully your kids dont drink as much as research scientists\" ( [1] )    love the mouseover text on this smbc comic: \"studying social science has completely obliterated my ability to enjoy pleasant human behaviors\" ( [1] )    smbc comic on political economy. dont miss the mouseover text on humans: \"in economics, theyre robots. in political economy, theyre all jerks. in sociology, theyre all misunderstood.\" ( [1] )

[but] we are a long way from creating virtual human beings  in the meantime, were going to have to deal with the hyperbole surrounding a.i.\" ( [1] )      tim oreilly: \"humans are increasingly going to be interacting with devices that are able to listen to us and talk back . [alexa] demonstrates that conversational interfaces can work, if they are designed right . smaller domains where you can deliver satisfying results, and within those domains, spend a lot of time thinking through the fit and finish so that interfaces are intuitive, interactions are complete, and that what most people try to do just works.\" ( [1] )       netflix: \"we think the combined effect of personalization and recommendations save us more than $1b per year\" ( [1]   [2]   [3] )      \"the main reasons cited for using ad blockers include avoiding disruptive ads (69%), ads that slow down their browsing experience (58%) and security / malware risks (56%). privacy wasn\u2019t the top answer. so facebook thinks if its can make its ads non-interruptive, fast, [useful,] and secure, people won\u2019t mind.\" ( [1]   [2] )       according to the nyt, uber lost $1.2b on $2.1b in revenue in h1 2016 ( [1]   [2] )         \"amazon reaches new high of 268,900 employees \u2014

often hard to distinguish\"\ufeff ( [1] )       \"[the] many confusing design decisions made us wonder if projects were assembled entirely from poor stackoverflow posts\" ( [1]   [2] )       amusing story of what happens when a geolocation is missing ( [1] )      on education: \"a feeling of hopefulness actually leads us to try harder and persist longer -- but only if it is paired with practical plans for achieving our goals, and specific, concrete actions we\u2019ll take when and if (usually when) our original plans don\u2019t work out as expected.\" ( [1] )       on management: \"we have to give them the space to fail in the short term so they can succeed and grow in the long term  there is that magical moment when we delegate and allow an emerging leader to grow into their new responsibilities, and they end up being way better at it than we ever were. that\u2019s real management success.\"\ufeff ( [1]   [2] )       on teams: \"the best teams respect one another\u2019s

"pub_datetime": "2018-01-22 00:00:00", "summary": " in this post i describe the  dslabs package , which contains some datasets that i use in my data science courses. \n a much discussed topic in stats education is that computing should play a more prominent role in the curriculum. i strongly agree, but i think the main improvement will come from bringing applications to the forefront and mimicking, as best as possible, the challenges applied statisticians face in real life. i therefore try to avoid using widely used  toy examples , such as the  mtcars  dataset, when i teach data science. however, my experience has been that finding examples that are both realistic, interesting, and appropriate for beginners is not easy. after a few years of teaching i have collected a few datasets that i think fit this criteria. to facilitate their use in introductory classes, i include them in the  dslabs package : \n  install.packages(\"dslabs\")  \n below i show some example of how you can use these datasets. you can see the datasets that are included here: \n  library(\"dslabs\")\ndata(package=\"dslabs\")  \n note that the package also includes some of the scripts used to wrangle the

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-12-20 00:00:00", "summary": "  editor\u2019s note: for the last few years i have made a list of awesome things that other people did ( 2016 , 2015 ,  2014 ,  2013 ). like in previous years i\u2019m making a list, again right off the top of my head.  if you know of some, you should make your own list or add it to the comments! i have also avoided talking about stuff i worked on or that people here at hopkins are doing because this post is supposed to be about other people\u2019s awesome stuff. i write this post because a blog often feels like a place to complain, but we started simply stats as a place to be pumped up about the stuff people were doing with data.  \n\n \n amelia mcnamara and aran lunzer made this  crazy nice illustration  of how histograms work. \n i am just continuously impressed by the work coming out of rahul satija\u2019s group - this year it was  this paper  on aligning cell populations in single cell data. \n karl broman and kara woo wrote the  definitive guide to data in spreadsheets  with the winner for most dense delivery of valuable information in a sentence in the last sentence of the abstract. \n the rest of the papers in the  peerj data science collection  are also awesome. \n thomas lin pederson came out with the  patchwork  package for composing plots. this is the plot organization software i\u2019ve always wanted :). \n getting  avericked  became a word as mara averick somehow makes everything r related look  so cool . \n the folks at  fast.ai  do so many impressive things (they are mooc geniuses) its hard to list just one to list, but this  post on data ethics  might be my favorite. \n kristian lum wrote the  most important blog post in statistics  and jump-started the discussion throughout our field on the standard of behavior we want to hold ourselves to as a field. \n hadley wickham is the lebron james of data science - so effortlessly great it is almost expected.  usethis  is yet another example of how he\u2019s revolutionizing package development (again). \n i looooovveeddd this post from  julia silge  on how to do word2vec like things with tidy data. such a beautiful distillation of something complicated into something we all can do. \n i only bought one stats book all year. it was  david robinson\u2019s empirical bayes book . an insta-classic. \n i\u2019ve been following nick strayer\u2019s dive into deep learning all year on  twitter , this post on  lstm with a baseball analogy  is a good example of the awesomeness. \n jeff kao had a  tour de force  post on identifying fake comments on the net neutrality repeal. such an impressively timed and high impact piece of forensic data science. \n mike love released his  amazing lecture notes  for his intro to computational biology class. i want to take a class from mike. \n the  keras  r package is sooooo nice. i love everything jj allaire does - whenever he writes software it always seems like he\u2019s read my mind and the way i\u2019d want the software to work it just does. \n jesse meagan\u2019s post on  educational data wrangling  was realy close to my heart. plus it is so awesome to read about her (impressive) transition from excel to r. something i\u2019m thinking about a ton these days. \n i\u2019ve been gobbling up cristoph molnar\u2019s  book on interpretable machine learning . \n the book on  tidytextmining  came out this year. what a tour-de-force from julia silge and david robinson. \n i read a lot of fastforward blog posts this year - one of my favorites was this one on  auditing machine learning models  - such an important topic. \n i love this post on the  ten fallacies of data science  - my favorite one? \u201cthe data exist\u201d. \n i basically read every one of ma\u00eblle salmon\u2019s blog post but i found her analysis of  seeds that people use in r  to be fascinating. i\u2019m looking forward to more on the epidemiology of code :). \n i dug emily robinson\u2019s  post on making r code faster  this is something i\u2019m adding to every class i teach in the future - so nice to see all the steps laid out so clearly! \n natalie telis did one of the most impressive  crowd sourced studies  of who is asking questions at the major genetics conference. i think solutions like this are so clever when they are low cost/low overhead but produce super interesting results. \n i liked stephen turner\u2019s updated post on  how to stay current in bioinformatics . keeping up is super hard to do well - so this is a big service for the community. \n its hard to point to just one thing karthik ram does for the r community in any given year, but i was pumped to see this call for  ropensci fellows . i know i\u2019m going to hit peak fomo whenever karthik is organizing. \n my main goal as an advisor is to be like  marta kutas -  \u201ci don\u2019t care what they become,\u201d she says of her students, \u201cso long as it\u2019s decent, thinking human beings!\u201d  \n i\u2019m such a fan of rob hyndman\u2019s forcasting work, and was pumped to see him on  datacamp . the data camp folks have been just vacuming up awesome people to teach courses. \n andrew bream did an amazing, polite, and thorough job of  setting me straight on deep learning . \n the  upsetr  package was a heartwarming contribution for those of us who are terrified of out of control venn diagrams. * i think florian markowetz consistently is one of the most thoughtful computational scientists. i read his stuff relentelessly but loved his idea for a  pre-registration of the human cell atlas . \n it was the year of  datasaurus ! i am in the process of replacing all my anscomb quartet lecture notes. what a cool idea by justin matejka and george fitzmaurice. \n there are times when i wonder whether emma pierson has created multiple ai copies of herself. how can one person write  so ,  many ,  awesome ,  things  in one year? \n ben haibe-kains and colleagues put together a tour-de-force in reproducibility  with pharmacodb . \n there is often talk of how academic statistics isn\u2019t supportive enough of non-standard (read: non-math) contributions. there is definitely truth there, but i love  lance waller  on navigating these non-standard paths in academics. \n i am so amped about the  skimr  package, especially the histograms as part of the summary statistics. \n christie aschwanden added another  awesome piece  to her collection of the most level-headed, responsible, and thoughtful discusison of the statistical issues in science. \n \n\n that\u2019s all i have for the moment. i\u2019m sure i missed a ton and i\u2019m sorry if i missed you - please add more in the comments i always love to see cool stuff!

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-12-20 00:00:00", "summary": "  note: this post was originally published as part of a collection of discussion pieces on david donoho\u2019s paper. the  original paper  and collection of discussions can be found at the  jcgs web site .  \n\n professor donoho\u2019s commentary comes at a perfect time, given that, according to his own chronology, we are just about due for another push to \u201cwiden the tent\u201d of statistics to include a broader array of activities. looking back at the efforts of people like tukey, cleveland, and chambers to broaden the meaning of statistics, i would argue that to some extent their efforts have failed. if you look at a textbook for a course in a typical phd program in statistics today, i believe it would look much like the textbooks used by cleveland, chambers, and tukey in their own studies. in fact, it might even be the same textbook! progress has been slow, in my opinion. but why is that? why can\u2019t statistics grow to more fully embrace the many activities that professor donoho describes in his six divisions of \u201cgreater data science\u201d? \n\n one frustration that i think many statisticians have in discussions of data science is that if you look at each of the six divisions that donoho lays out\u2014data exploration, data transformation, computing, modeling, visualization, and science of data science\u2014statisticians  do  all those things. but the truth is, we do not  teach  most of them. over the years, the teaching of statistics has expanded to include topics like computing and visualization, but typically as optional or ancillary courses. many of the activities on donoho\u2019s list are things that students are assumed to \u201cfigure out on their own\u201d without any formal instruction. asymptotic theory, on the other hand,  requires  formal instruction. \n\n in my own experience, the biggest challenge to teaching the areas of greater data science is that it is difficult and can be very inefficient. ultimately, i believe these are the reasons that we as a field choose not to teach this material. many of the areas in the six divisions, data exploration and transformation, can be frustratingly difficult to generalize. if i clean up administrative claims data from medicare and link them to air pollution data from the environmental protection agency, does any of the knowledge i gain from those activities apply to the processing of rna-seq data and linking it with clinical phenotypes? it\u2019s difficult to see any connection. on the other hand, both datasets will likely serve as inputs to a generalized linear model. rather than teach one course on cleaning administrative claims data and another course on processing rna-seq data, consider how many birds can be hit with the three stones of an exponential family, a link function, and a linear predictor? furthermore, the behavior of generalized linear models can be analyzed mathematically to make incredibly useful predictions about the variability of their estimates. \n\n the lack of a formal framework for \u201cdata cleaning\u201d reduces the teaching of the subject to a parade of special cases. while each case might be of interest to some, it\u2019s unlikely that any case would be applicable to all. in any institution of higher learning with finite resources, it\u2019s impossible to provide formal instruction on all the special cases to everybody who needs them. it\u2019s much more efficient to teach the generalized linear model and the central limit theorem. \n\n is the lack of a formal framework for some areas of data science attributable to some fundamental aspect of those topics, or does it arise simply from a lack of trying? in my opinion, the evidence to date lays the blame on our field\u2019s traditional bias towards to use of mathematics as the principal tool for analysis. indeed, much of the interesting formal work being done in data cleaning and transformation makes use of a completely different toolbox, one largely drawing from computer science and software engineering. because of this different toolbox, our field has been blinded to recent developments and has missed an important opportunity to cultivate more academic leaders in this area. \n\n professor donoho rightly highlights the work of hadley wickham and yihui xie, both statisticians, who have made seminal contributions to the field of statistics in their development of the ggplot2, knitr, dplyr, and many other packages for r. it is notable that wickham\u2019s paper outlining the concept of \u201ctidy data\u201d, a concept which has sparked a minor revolution in the field of data analysis, was originally published in the journal of statistical software, a nominally \u201capplied\u201d journal. i would argue that such a paper more properly belongs in the annals of statistics than in a software journal. the formal framework offered in that paper has inspired the creation of numerous \u201ctidy data\u201d approaches to analyzing data that have proven remarkably simple to use and understand. the \u201cgrammar\u201d outlined in wickham\u2019s paper and implemented in the dplyr package serve as an abstraction whose usefulness has been demonstrated in a variety of situations. the lack of mathematical notation in the presentation of dplyr or any of its \u201ctidyverse\u201d relatives does not make it less useful nor does it make it less broadly applicable. \n\n finally, it is worth a comment that the people that professor donoho cites as driving previous pushes to widen the tent of statistics either did not initially come from academia or at least straddled the boundary. cleveland, chambers, and tukey all spent significant time in industry and government settings and that experience no doubt colored their perspectives. moving to today, it might just be a coincidence that both wickham and xie are employed outside of academia by rstudio, but i doubt it. perhaps it is always the case that the experts come from somewhere else. however, i fear that academic statistics will miss out on the opportunity to recruit bright people who are making contributions in a manner not familiar to many of us.

the actual extent and application of ai is much smaller. in fact, most ai usually ends up  being humans in the end . \n\n while the promise of ai/ml has never been clearer, there are still only a handful of organizations that are using the technology in a major way. sometimes even apparent success stories  turn out to be problematic . \n\n i was thinking about the lifecycle of developing an ai application. i have defined this type of application previously as having  three parts : (i) an interface to humans, (ii) a data set, and (iii) an algorithm for turning the data into interactions. i started thinking about the extension of this idea to the development of an ai application and all the steps involved. then i started thinking about potential barriers. \n\n   \n\n to develop an ai application you need a few things: \n\n \n a group of people who are willing to let you have their data. \n a technology for data capture from people (this could be as simple as a website, or an echo, or as complex as a robot). \n a data storage mechanism for collecting the raw data from this input (this could just be a database) \n a set of algorithms and scripts for organizing the data for analysis. \n a definition of the problem you\u2019d like to solve in quantitative terms - usually generated through exploratory analysis. \n an algorithm trained on a  massive data set  or at minimum trained with a  good prior or expert knowledge . \n a way to structure the responses and provide feedback either to the original users of your application or to other users (researchers or executives at a company for example). \n the pipeline to take those formatted responses and return them to the user in a way that they can take advantage of. \n \n\n i think that a lot of attention is focused on step 6 and how costly talent is for  designing ai algorithms . i think for the big players where a lot of the other steps have been solved this is for sure the limiting factor and it is no wonder that the talent war is fierce. \n\n but i think that for 95% of organizations - whether they be researchers, businesses, or individuals the problem isn\u2019t in developing the algorithm. a random forest can be fit with one line of r code and while it won\u2019t be as accurate as an expertly trained neural network on a gigantic training data set, it will be really useful. \n\n so i think that most of the roadblocks to the democratization of ai are actually in the other steps and in particular the \u201cglue\u201d between the steps. for example: \n\n \n  getting access to people\u2019s data (step 0)  - it is very hard, even for researchers, to get access to health information if you aren\u2019t deepmind and google. it can take years to deal with the bureaucracy of getting access to even simple data sets. \n  having the infrastructure to capture data (step 1)  if you aren\u2019t a major player you might not even be capturing complete data from people visiting your website, let alone sensors, images, text, and everything else you would want to do to perform ai. \n  storing data centrally (step 2)  in almost all of the organizations i\u2019ve talked to data are scattered and managed across multiple systems and with different protocols. just knowing where and what the data are can be a multi-month process. \n  tidying the data (step 3)  there is an entire industry of data scientists built to tackle this problem, but if you can\u2019t find the data or if the data isn\u2019t stored centrally (step 2), then this can be delayed. even if it isn\u2019t, there is rarely a standardized data tidying pipeline even in places that only have one data type - so that makes it hard to do the next step. \n  defining a question ai can answer (step 4)  i would venture to say this is maybe one of the biggest bottlenecks. to create an ai system as they currently exist a human needs to (i) define a concrete scientific/business problem, (ii) create a quantitative definition of that model, and (iii) define an objective function to optimize. this process can take a huge amount of expert/knowledgeable work. \n  fitting the algorithm (step 5)  while i think there are some commodity technologies that work well here - streamlining the process from modeling to implementation is probably where a lot of ai applications could use work. this can take a while to just get the model set up even after you know exactly what you want to fit. \n  making the model output mean something to humans (step 6)  even in the cases where we ideally want the computer to do everything (self driving cars) we\u2019d still like to summarize the choices the ai might make so humans can decide if they are ethical and how to regulate those decisions. but there is still a whole field of ai that is interpretable that needs to be developed and disseminated. so even places that have models built often struggle to communicate the results in a way that they can be used. \n  automating the use of ai models (step 7)  even if you get past all those other hurdles and have a working, interpretable ai model, you need humans to use it. whether that is a doctor using the output of a radiology scan to make diagnostic/treatment decisions, or a car that can actually drive, the last step of actually making the model useful is still a major barrier to many projects. \n \n\n i think a lot of these barriers come down to the fact that for the most part we don\u2019t have strict standards for data capture/tidying/organization/use that are used across organizations. we also don\u2019t have the \u201cglue\u201d steps between each of these components automated. so while i think that the algorithms for ai will continue to develop rapidly in accuracy and range, for organizations to keep up they will need a lot more than just a way to fit the latest model. the reason that i think some organizations are leaping so far ahead is that they already have spent a huge amount of time thinking about all the steps but the model fitting, so now they can focus their time/energy/resources on making algorithms do things we didn\u2019t imagine were possible.

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-11-21 00:00:00", "summary": " i was listening to the effort report episode on  the messy execution of reproducible research  where they were discussing the piece about  amy cuddy in the new york times . i think both the article and the podcast did a good job of discussing the nuances of the importance of reproducibility and the challenges of the social interactions around this topic. after listening to the podcast i realized that i see a lot of posts about reproducibility/replicability, but many of them are focused on the technical side. so i started to think about compiling a list of more cultural things we can do to reduce the stress/pressure around the reproducibility crisis. \n\n i\u2019m sure others have pointed these out in other places but i am procrastinating writing something else so i\u2019m writing these down while i\u2019m thinking about them :). \n\n \n  we can define what we mean by \u201creproduce\u201d and \u201creplicate\u201d  different fields have different definitions of the words  reproduce  and  replicate . if you are publishing a new study we now have an  r package  that you can use to create figures that show what changed and what was the same betweeen the original study and your new work. defining concretely what was the same and different will reduce some of the miscommunication about what a reproducibility/replicability study means. \n  we can remember that replication is statistical, not deterministic  if you are doing a new study where you re-collect data according to a protocol from another group - you should not expect to get exactly the same answer. so if a result is statistically significant in one study and not significant in another,  that may be within the bounds of what we\u2019d expect to see . \n  we can remember that there is a difference between exploratory and confirmatory research  there is a reason that randomized trials are the basis for regulatory decisions by the fda and others. but if we require every single study to meet the requirements of a pre-registered, randomized, double blind controlled trial with a huge sample size we might miss some  important   discoveries . \n  we can remember that a failed replication isn\u2019t always a scientific failure  one thing roger and elizabeth point out is that many scientific studies won\u2019t replicate - nor should we expect all studies to replicate. sometimes a study is preliminary, exploratory, or the first observation of an unusual event. it may be a perfectly well executed study, and not replicate because the sample size was too small or there was an unmodeled confounder. this doesn\u2019t mean that the scientific study was a failure, it just was an observation that didn\u2019t pan out. \n  we can stop publicizing scientific results as solutions so quickly  university press offices, startup companies, and researchers stressed for funding are under pressure to label every discovery as a \u201ccure\u201d, a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d, a \u201csolution to the crisis\u201d. a lot of the frustration in the scientific community arises from this overstatement of results. it is hard to escape this (for me too!) - but we can excercise skepticism about claims of solutions on the basis of single scientific papers. \n  we can be persistent and private as long as possible  like many people i\u2019ve run into frustrating cases where data isn\u2019t available from a paper that has been published. i have contacted the authors only to be rebuffed. i have found that it takes work to convince them to provide the data, but i can often do it without having to resort to publicizing the problems and trying to make it adversarial. \n  we can make the realization that data is valuable but in science you don\u2019t own it  there is still discussion of  data parasites and data symbionts. i have been both a data collector and a data analyst. i realize there is frustration to releasing your data and seeing others quickly publish ideas you may have had. at the same time i\u2019ve seen how frustrating it can be to see people keep their data private and inaccessable indefinitely after publication. the reality is that people do deserve credit for collecting data, but that they don\u2019t own the data they collect. \n  we should cut each other some slack  i think that a lot of the frustration around reproducibility and replicability can come from the way the problem is approached. on the one hand, if you publish a scientific paper and someone tries to reproduce or replicate your work you can realize that they are doing that because they are  interested  and try to help them. even if they find some flaws (as they inevitably will) or the study doesn\u2019t replicate (as it might not) that is not a failure by you. on the other hand if you are reproducibing or replicating, remember that the scientist on the other end is a person. that person is subject to all the same funding, publication, and promotion stresses as everyone else. so we should try not to make the discovery of reproducibility/replicability problems high profile \u201cgotchas\u201d but focus on pointing out the real scientific issues that arise and trying to move forward in a positive way. \n \n\n like many others, i have noticed that the stakes around reproducibility/replicability have been ratcheted up by social media and the  rise in the prominence of the field of reproducibility . as someone who has experienced the real stress all of this can create in the life of real scientists, i\u2019d love to see if we could move forward in a way that was more positive and collaborative while we address the explosion of data in the scientific enterprise.

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-11-16 00:00:00", "summary": " in my ongoing discussion in my mind about  what makes for a good data analysis , one of the ideas that keeps coming back to me is this notion of being able to \u201creason about the data\u201d. the idea here is that it\u2019s important that a data analysis allow you to understand how the  data , as opposed to other aspects of an analysis like assumptions or models, played a role in producing the outputs. i think for a given problems, some kinds of analysis do a better job of that than others. \n \n to collect garbage or not? \n programmers talk a lot about the importance of being able to \u201creason about code\u201d, in part so that you can understand what\u2019s going on and perhaps make modifications in the future. if there are two software solutions that produce equivalent results, one might prefer the one that allows you to reason about the code and about what the software is doing, even if it is less efficient. aside from having a certain common sense logic to it, there are also important implications for maintaining the code. \n along these lines, a while back i was listening to one of my favorite podcasts, the  accidental tech podcast , when  chris lattner  made a  surprise appearance . chris previously created llvm and worked at apple where he developed the swift programming language. on this episode, around the 1 hour and 56 minute mark, lattner and john siracusa get into a discussion about memory management models for programming languages. in particular, siracusa asks lattner to discuss garbage collection versus automatic reference counting (arc), a system that lattner developed while working at apple. \n \n  john siracusa : objective-c had garbage collection, as you mentioned. eventually, objective-c dropped the garbage collection and got arc [automatic reference counting], and of course, swift doesn\u2019t have garbage collection at all. can you talk about the trade-offs there and why swift is the way it is? \n \n just as a quick summary,  garbage collection  is a system by which programmers can allocate memory for objects and not have to worry about de-allocating the memory when their done with it. the idea is that a separate process called the garbage collector periodically goes through all the memory that a program is using and checks to see if it still being used by some aspect of the program. if the memory is not being used, the garbage collector marks the memory as available so that it can be allocated for something else. if the garbage collector never ran, then eventually all the memory would get allocated and nothing would free up. \n here\u2019s how siracusa sells it: \n \n  siracusa : well, the idea [is] that memory management is completely out of the hands of the programmer, and that some magical fairy behind the scenes will make it all good for you. what you\u2019re giving up, as you mentioned before\u2026you lack some amount of control\u2026 \n \n if you use r, you\u2019re using an application that uses a garbage collector (originally written by  luke tierney ). if you\u2019ve ever noticed that sometimes you run an operation in r that normally takes a short amount of time and it takes an unusually long time to run, that\u2019s often because r had to stop for a second or two to let the garbage collector run in the background. this \u201cstutter\u201d is the bane of all applications that use garbage collection. you can actually force the garbage collector to run in r by calling the  gc()  function (although you should never have to do that in practice). i don\u2019t think the \u201cstutter\u201d is a big issue in r, but it can be a big problem for applications that demand a fluid user experience. \n one downside of garbage collection is that it addes a random aspect to program operation. since you never know when the garbage collector is going to get called (that is based on runtime conditions), you never know when your program is going to be halted to allow the garbage collector to do its thing. the upside though is that programmers don\u2019t have to worry about memory management, which is often the source of nasty bugs. \n  automatic reference counting  is essentially a fancier version of manual memory management, where programmers have to manual allocate and deallocate. but instead, with arc the  compiler  does most of the work for you. in order to allow for this, certain restrictions must be placed on the language to allow the compiler to analyze programs and determine whether certain blocks of memory will be in use at a given time. the advantage here is that the analysis occurs at compile time, thus allowing for the running of a program to be deterministic. the downside, of course, is that the programmer has to do more deliberate thinking about memory. \n a key question then, as posed by lattner is this: \n \n  chris lattner : you said gc [garbage collection] means that you don\u2019t have to think about memory. is that true? \n \n frankly, before hearing the rest, i would have said \u201cyes, it\u2019s true\u201d. but lattner continues (emphasis added): \n \n  lattner : the stutter problem, to me, isn\u2019t really the issue, even though that\u2019s what gc-haters will bring up all the time. it\u2019s more about  being able to reason about when the memory goes away . the most important aspect of that is that arc gets rid of finalizers. \n \n \n if you use a garbage-collected language, you use finalizers. finalizers are the thing that gets run when your object gets destroyed. finalizers have so many problems that there are entire bodies of work talking about how to work around problems with finalizers. \n \n \n for example, the finalizer gets run on the wrong thread, it has to get run multiple times, the object can get resurrected while the finalizer\u2019s running. it happens non-deterministically later. you can\u2019t count on it, and so you can\u2019t use it for resource management for database handles and things like that, for example. there are so many problems with finalizers that arc just defines [it] away by having deterministic destruction. \n \n even without knowing what a finalizer is, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a lot of complexity involved with using a garbage collector. lattner\u2019s final point is critical: \n \n  lattner : there\u2019s this question of if you\u2019re building a large scale system, do you want people to \u201cnever think about memory?\u201d do you want them to think about memory all the time, like they did in objective-c\u2019s classic manual retain-and-release? or do you want something in the middle? \n \n his argument is that arc is that \u201csomething in the middle\u201d. \n \n  lattner : i think that arc strikes a really interesting balance, whether it\u2019s in objective-c or swift. i look at manual retain-and-release as being a very imperative style of memory management\u2026where you\u2019re telling the code, line by line\u2026this is what you should do at this point in time. \n \n \n arc then takes that model and bubbles it up a big step, and it makes it be a very declarative model\u2026. the cool thing about that to me is that not only does it get rid of the mechanics of maintaining reference counting and define away tons of bugs by doing that, it also means that it is now explicit in your code what your intention was. that\u2019s something that people who maintain your code benefit from. \n \n the promise of garbage collection is clear:  the programmer doesn\u2019t have to think about memory . lattner\u2019s criticism is that when building large-scale systems the programmer  always  has to think about memory, and as such, garbage collection makes it  harder  to do so. the goal of arc is to make it easier for other people to understand your code and to allow programmers to reason clearly about memory. \n \n \n what about data? \n what does any of this have to do with data analysis? well, nothing, directly. but i think there is an analogous spectrum of techniques in data analysis. in programming, one can think of garbage collection (\u201cno thinking\u201d) on one end of the spectrum and manual memory management (\u201cconstantly thinking\u201d) on the other end. with data analysis, there are certain black box-type procedures proposed on one end and, well, just an uncoordinated jumble of procedures on the other end of the spectrum. \n when i mention \u201cblack box-type\u201d procedures, i\u2019m not referring to machine learning prediction models, which are often derided as \u201cblack boxes\u201d because of their complexity. rather, i\u2019m thinking of a way of doing data analysis that focuses primarily on outcomes and results. with these kinds of approaches, the discussion is almost entirely focused on whether the outcomes are \u201ccorrect\u201d or not, which i think is misguided in many scientific contexts. with prediction models, at least initially, it makes sense to focus on outcomes. but with data analysis, we often want to know more about how the data are connected to those outcomes. \n one famous example of how seemingly equivalent methods can diverge is  anscombe\u2019s quartet . anscombe presented four datasets that have exactly the same summary statistics but appear very different when plotted. in particular, the correlations for the four datasets are the same. my take from his paper is that computing a correlation coefficient provides a  result  and the correlation will provide you some information about the data. we could have endless discussions about whether this result is correct, whether it truly exists in the population, whether it might replicate in the next study, or whether we should have used some other correlation metric. but none of that matters once you make a scatterplot of the data. the scatterplots show you  how  the data inform the result. in this case, there are four different ways in which the data can inform a given correlation coefficient, some of which are perhaps more concerning than others. \n the scatterplots in anscombe\u2019s quartet allow us to reason about the data in a way that the correlation coefficient alone does not. they tell us more about what is going on with the data and aid us in interpreting the correlation coefficient. in this case, i think an analysis that includes the scatterplots is a  better data analysis  than one that does not. of course, the scatterplots alone may not be sufficient because they don\u2019t actually give you a number, which may be needed in subsequent analyses. but there\u2019s nothing that says you can\u2019t do both. \n this is more than simply saying that you should make plots (although you  should ). when you run a simple linear regression, there are two contributing parts: (a) the data and (b) the assumption of linearity. reporting the regression coefficient gives you a sense of the strength of the relationship between the predictor and the response, but does that relationship arise from the data or from the model\u2019s assumptions? any analysis that can help the reader elicit the relative contributions of those two components is better than an analysis that doesn\u2019t. \n \n \n evaluating data analysis \n interestingly, anscombe laid out four \u201cmyths\u201d that he hoped to debunk: \n \n  numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough;  \n  for any particular kind of statistical data there is just one set of calculations constituting a correct statistical analysis;  \n  performing intricate calculations is virtuous, whereas actually looking at the data is cheating.  \n \n unfortunately, i think these three ideas are alive and well in much of the world of data analysis, especially points 2 and 3. in discussions with various people about what makes for a good data analysis, i\u2019ve found there\u2019s a common focus on \u201ccorrectness\u201d. for example, if a data analysis leads to a result that later replicates, then the original analysis is a good one. it\u2019s hard to be against correctness, but i think it\u2019s misguided. in particular, the correctness of a scientific claim cannot usually be evaluated with a single study, so this would imply that you cannot evaluate the data analysis that went into making that claim. if a replication study occurs 10 years later, that would imply that we will be waiting 10 years to determine if a data analysis is good. \n i think it should be possible to evaluate the quality of a data analysis once it\u2019s done, not 10 years later when a replication study verifies a scientific claim. one way to do so is to ask whether the analysis allows us to reason about the data relative to another possible analysis. if we can answer the question, \u201chow do the data in this study inform the result?\u201d then i think we are in good shape. \n ", "kwds": ["in", "my", "ongoing", "discussion", "in", "my", "mind", "about", "href=\"https://youtu.be", "qftjaq4tlqe\"", "what",

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-10-30 00:00:00", "summary": " i just got back from the  ropensci ozunconf  that was run in melbourne last week. i\u2019d like to give a big thanks to the organizers (nick tierney, di cook, rob hyndman and others) for putting on a great unconference. these events are always a great opportunity to meet people just getting started in the r community and to get them involved. \n\n as is typical for these unconferences, topic ideas were pitched via issues on the  ozunconf github repo . one issue that i filed was titled  \u201chow do you pitch r to new users?\u201d . while this issue was not taken up during the unconference (for good reason, i think), nick was kind enough to initiate a lunch time discussion of the topic (with  daniel falster  kindly taking notes). \n\n the topic came up in my mind because i\u2019ve found that i\u2019ve had to change the way that i \u201csell\u201d r to new users. through various discussions at the unconference and in many other venues, i\u2019ve found that many r users, even today, are the \u201clone r user\u201d in their group/institution/organization. while they may enjoy using r, it\u2019s often made difficult by the fact that others in their group do not use r and therefore there is some negotiation over \u201chow things get done\u201d. convincing others in the group to use r is one way to go (i suppose abandoning r is the other) and the question of how best to do this for different audiences is the question that arose in my mind. as a teacher, you can usually design the curriculum so that the students are forced to use r. but in most other environments, a different approach is needed. \n\n as part of the introduction to the topic, i talked about how i used to convince others to use r. bear in mind, this was almost 20 years ago and the majority of people i was talking to were using sas, stata, spss, excel, or some other commercial package. these were largely interactive packages, perhaps with graphical user interfaces, designed to do more or less traditional statistical analyses. my pitch usually involved three things: \n\n \n   free . r was both free as in cost and free as in  free software . the free cost part made it a highly accessible package and the free software part allowed for anyone to tinker with the package, inspect its code, and make improvements.  \n\n   graphics .  r was able to produce high quality \u201cpublication ready\u201d graphics and it gave you detailed control over all the graphical elements. s-plus could also do this but s-plus didn\u2019t come with the free part mentioned above.  \n\n   programming language . unlike packages like sas, stata, or spss, r came with a robust and sophisticated lisp-like programming language that was well-suited for data analysis applications. in addition, you could use it to build packages that could extend the core r system.  \n \n\n much has changed since those early days and i\u2019ve varied my pitch quite a bit to focus on a few different things (that didn\u2019t exist back then). in particular, the audience has changed\u2014i talk to many more people who are just getting started in data analysis and therefore are a bit more open-minded about which software to use. also, python has come on the scene as a viable alternative to r for data science and so there are even more arguments to consider. some of the things i focus on now are \n\n \n   reproducibility  and reporting . with the development of knitr and its combination with r markdown, the writing of reproducible reports was made infinitely easier. (markdown itself, probably deserves its own discussion, but it\u2019s not specifically r-related.)  \n\n   rstudio . the development of the rstudio ide has made getting started with r much easier. having a powerful ide was important to me for learning other languages and i\u2019m glad r finally has something solid for itself. rstudio has significantly simplified the development of r packages via devtools and roxygen2. while it\u2019s not yet perfect, these tools have changed what used to be a labor-intensive and finicky process into a more manageable and easier to learn work flow.  \n\n   graphics . r still has the ability to make great data graphics and with the introduction of  ggplot2 , it has become easier to make good graphics.  \n\n   r packages and community . with over 10,000 packages on cran alone,  there\u2019s pretty much a package to do anything . more importantly, the people contributing those packages and the greater r community have expanded tremendously over time, bringing in new users and pushing r to be useful in more applications. eveyr year now there are probably hundreds if not thousands of meetups, conferences, seminars, and workshops all around the world, all related to r.  \n \n\n discussion \n\n at the unconference, a number of people had different approaches to how to convince others to use r. here are just a summary: \n\n \n someone mentioned the  bioconductor , which is a huge resource for those doing research in the world of high throughput biology. not many other packages have something similar so it makes an obvious selling point to people working in this area \n the idea of using r end-to-end came up, meaning using r to clean up messy data and taking it all the way to some interactive shiny app on the other end. the idea that you can use the same tool to do all the things in between made for a compelling case for r. \n for the spreadsheet audience, the  dplyr  package was sometimes a good selling point. the idea here was that you could show people how much time could be saved by automating analyses and using  dplyr  to clean up data. \n the open source nature of r came up a few times, primarily as a means for developing transferable skills. if you work at a company/institution that specializes in some proprietary package, it\u2019s often difficult to transfer those skills somewhere else if your new job doesn\u2019t use that package. the fact that r is open source means that, in theory, you could use it anywhere and the skills that you build up in r are (again, in theory) applicable everywhere. \n someone mentioned that if you want to convince someone to learn/use r, just show them the multitude of jobs available to r programmers (and in particular, the salaries attached to them). \n the fact that r is obtainable for free is still important, given that matlab and sas licenses have not gotten any cheaper over time. in my experience, this is particularly important in non-industrialized countries where for many people paying for expensive licenses is not an option. \n \n\n this just a brief summary of our discussion at the unconference and i was heartened to see all of the enthusiasm for r there. even with r\u2019s incredible growth over the last 20 years, there will still come a time when a case needs to be made to use r over something else. i\u2019m just glad that we have so many more reasons today than we used to.

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-10-09 00:00:00", "summary": " on the latest episode of  not so standard deviations  i talked with hilary about apple\u2019s efforts to train machine learning algorithms in their face id technology in the iphone x. the gist of face id is that it recognizes your face using a mathematical representation and then unlocks the phone when it can confirm that it is you. in its keynote presentation, apple mentioned that it\u2019s using machine learning to do this and even had developed its own custom chips to do the computations. \n\n there were many questions regarding face id, including how exactly apple had trained this machine learning model without it ever being released to the public. there were natural concerns that the system would only recognize certain kinds of faces, perhaps of certain ethnic backgrounds or of certain shapes or sizes. two bits of evidence indicate that apple likely spent a lot of money in this training process. the first bit comes from craig federighi, senior vice president for software engineering, in an  interview with tech crunch , \n\n \n \u201cphil [schiller] mentioned that we\u2019d gathered a billion images and that we\u2019d done data gathering around the globe to make sure that we had broad geographic and ethnic data sets. both for testing and validation for great recognition rates,\u201d says federighi. \u201cthat wasn\u2019t just something you could go pull off the internet.\u201d \n\n especially given that the data needed to include a high-fidelity depth map of facial data. so, says federighi, apple went out and got consent from subjects to provide scans that were \u201cquite exhaustive.\u201d those scans were taken from many angles and contain a lot of detail that was then used to train the face id system. \n \n\n the second bit of information comes from the  accidental tech podcast  where a listener wrote in to describe a study that he had recently enrolled in that took very detailed images of his face. although there is no explicit connection, it would sound by the description that this study could have been related to the face id efforts (you can hear casey liss discuss the study <a href=\"accidental tech podcast: 240: undefined wait period\nhttps://overcast.fm/+cdqobnmk/1:15:23\">here ). apparently, the study was being conducted by  exponent  which from its web site appears to be a scientific and technical consulting firm. \n\n given the two bits of information, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say that \n\n \n  apple decided it needed a huge dataset to train the face id algorithm and that no such dataset existed that they could access  \n\n  having no real desire to collect such data themselves, apple outsourced the study to a third party company (in much the same way a biotech company might outsource a clinical trial to a clinical research organization) to collect the data to their specifications. the outsourcing also allowed apple to shield its identity in the process so that they could keep the whole face id system secret.  \n\n  the collected dataset (and the subsequently trained model) effectively serve as the \u201cprior\u201d distribution in a complex classification scheme that is adapted to a specific user once a user allows the iphone x to collect their face data.  \n \n\n apple claims that user data is not sent back to apple for privacy reasons, so that the \u201cbig\u201d model is not updated according to user data. perhaps apple will continue to collect data separately from user data, but there was no mention of that. \n\n if any of this is true, there are a few things worth noting: \n\n \n  this is not the way things are done silicon valley these days. a perhaps less costly way would be to give some app away for free (like a fun game or something similar), let the app take a bunch of pictures of you from different angles, and then gather all the data to train a model. of course, such an approach would be subject to the selection bias that all approaches like this suffer from, because the data only represents the people whom the company could get to use the product.  \n\n  it must have been very expensive to conduct this study, although that is less of a big deal when you have  over $150 billion in net cash . that said, only a handful of companies could afford to do this and certainly not your average startup.  \n\n  if the face id system works well and is capable of recognizing the diversity of faces that represent the iphone customer base, then it would suggest that getting this kind of machine learning right  costs a lot of money . in particular, it highlights the limitations of crowdsourcing-as-data-collection and it would suggest that old-fashioned ideas of sampling and experimental design are still needed once in a while.  \n \n\n is it research? \n\n on twitter, someone mused that wouldn\u2019t it be nice if they released all this data to the public? certainly, it would be a valuable and unique resource if they did and would likely spur a wealth of new innovations. of course, this will almost certainly not happen, if only because apple considers this dataset a key to their competitive advantage in the area of face detection, which they believe is the future of authentication. why give this up to their competitors? indeed, i don\u2019t think anyone would expect apple to give up this dataset any more than we might expect google to give up data it collects from its search engine. \n\n on the other hand, if i had conducted a study collecting similar face information (albeit on a smaller scale!) and published a paper about my findings about face morphology, there would likely be an expectation of me to release my data to the public along with the findings. and  rightly so ! reproducibility is critical to moving science forward and releasing the data allows others to reproduce the findings. furthermore, such a dataset would likely be useful to others investigations and would benefit all of science. \n\n but why is there is no expectation for apple to release data from its study but there is an expectation on me to release data from my study? \n\n in my opinion, apple is not conducting research, even though it kind of looks like it is. rather, apple is doing product development, which requires some gathering of information as part of the process. the fact that the information gathering was done on such a large scale isn\u2019t relevant. just as any consumer packaged goods company might gather a focus group before developing their next toothpaste, apple gathered face data in order to develop face id. \n\n i often argue with people over whether companies like google, facebook, and apple do research. my argument is that for the most part, they do not, because they are not interested in creating new knowledge. they do not make any specific public claims or inferences about the data they\u2019ve gathered and so there isn\u2019t really anything for them to defend. they are interested in taking whatever information they collected and channeling it into products. yes, all of these companies occasionally publish a paper (i think apple has a  grand total of five ), and i would say that those papers represent real research. but i would wager that those papers represent a small fraction of the work going on in those companies. \n\n as a side note,  mark neuman  on twitter suggested that this kind of work does qualify as research for the purposes of evaluating the ethical treatment of research sbjects. i would have to agree here, and i would hope that all of these companies obtain proper informed consent from subjects before collecting their data (at least their lawyers spend a lot of time thinking about it). the fact that these companies may be collecting these data for product development and not for research doesn\u2019t absolve them of the need to treat subjects properly.

electronic health records we propose a deep learning algorithm to learn a low dimensional representation (embedding) of patients from their raw electronic health records. we evaluate our embeddings with descriptive analysis and a code assignement task. these representations would be reusable for other tasks such as patient similarity for cohort selection, information retrieval, electronic

process (1% success rate from hit to pre-clinical candidate)\u2026 iktos aims to leverage big data and ai to bring radical improvement to this process. iktos has invented and is developing a truly innovative and disruptive artificial intelligence technology for ligand-based de novo drug design, focusing on multi parametric optimization (mpo). our proprietary technology is built upon the latest developments in deep learning algorithms. in a few hours, our technology can design new, druggable and synthesizable molecules, that are optimized to match all your selection criteria.     +

john k. tsotsos   training deep neural networks results in strong learned representations that show good generalization capabilities. in most cases, training involves iterative modification of all weights inside the network via back-propagation. in this paper, we propose to take an extreme approach and fix \\emph{almost all weights} of a deep convolutional neural network in their randomly initialized values, allowing only a small portion to be learned. as our experiments show, this often results in performance which is on par with the performance of learning all weights. the implications of this intriguing property or deep neural networks are discussed and we suggest ways to harness it to create more robust representations.\u00a0 h/t  iacopo  and  miles      liked this

perturbations around the random configuration          ah, its one of the first slides and i already like it !                                      here are some of the recent work by\u00a0 jeffrey :        a  correspondence between random neural networks and statistical field theory  by\u00a0 samuel s. schoenholz ,  jeffrey pennington ,  jascha sohl-dickstein      a number of recent papers have provided evidence that practical design questions about neural networks may be tackled theoretically by studying the behavior of random networks. however, until now the tools available for analyzing random neural networks have been relatively ad-hoc. in this work, we show that the distribution of pre-activations in random neural networks can be exactly mapped onto lattice models in statistical physics. we argue that several previous investigations of stochastic networks actually studied a particular factorial approximation to the full lattice model. for random linear networks and random rectified linear networks we show that the corresponding lattice models in the wide network limit may be systematically approximated by a gaussian distribution with covariance between the layers of the network. in each case, the approximate distribution can be diagonalized by fourier transformation. we show that this approximation accurately describes the results of numerical simulations of wide random neural networks. finally, we demonstrate that in each case the large scale behavior of the random networks can be approximated by an effective field theory.      nonlinear random matrix theory for deep learning \u00a0by\u00a0 jeffrey pennington ,\u00a0 pratik worah   neural network configurations with random weights play an important role in the analysis of deep learning. they define the initial loss landscape and are closely related to kernel and random feature methods. despite the fact that these networks are built out of random matrices, the vast and powerful machinery of random matrix theory has so far found limited success in studying them. a main obstacle in this direction is that neural networks are nonlinear, which prevents the straightforward utilization of many of the existing mathematical results. in this work, we open the door for direct applications of random matrix theory to deep learning by demonstrating that the pointwise nonlinearities typically applied in neural networks can be incorporated into a standard method of proof in random matrix theory known as the moments method. the test case for our study is the gram matrix y^ty, y=f(wx), where w is a random weight matrix, x is a random data matrix, and f is a pointwise nonlinear activation function. we derive an explicit representation for the trace of the resolvent of this matrix, which defines its limiting spectral distribution. we apply these results to the computation of the asymptotic performance of single-layer random feature methods on a memorization task and to the analysis of the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix as it propagates through a neural network. as a byproduct of our analysis, we identify an intriguing new class of activation functions with favorable properties.       geometry of neural network loss surfaces via random matrix theory \u00a0by jeffrey pennington, yasaman bahri   understanding the geometry of neural network loss surfaces is important for the\u00a0 development of improved optimization algorithms and for building a theoretical understanding of why deep learning works. in this paper, we study the geometry in terms of the distribution of eigenvalues of the hessian matrix at critical points of varying energy. we introduce an analytical framework and a set of tools from random matrix theory that allow us to compute an approximation of this distribution under a set of simplifying assumptions. the shape of the spectrum depends strongly on the energy and another key parameter, $\\phi $, which measures the ratio of parameters to data points. our analysis predicts and numerical simulations support that for critical points of small index, the number of negative eigenvalues scales like the 3/2 power of the energy. we leave as an open problem an explanation for ur observation that, in the context of a certain memorization task, the energy of minimizers is well-approximated by the function 1/2(1\u2212\u03d5)21/2(1\u2212\u03d5)2. not strictly relatedd to random matrix theory:   deep neural networks as gaussian processes \u00a0by\u00a0 jaehoon lee ,\u00a0 yasaman bahri ,\u00a0 roman novak ,\u00a0 samuel s. schoenholz ,\u00a0 jeffrey pennington ,\u00a0 jascha sohl-dickstein      a deep fully-connected neural network with an i.i.d. prior over its parameters is equivalent to a gaussian process (gp) in the limit of infinite network width. this correspondence enables exact bayesian inference for neural networks on regression tasks by means of straightforward matrix computations. for single hidden-layer networks, the covariance function of this gp has long been known. recently, kernel functions for multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside of a bayesian framework. as such, previous work has not identified the correspondence between using these kernels as the covariance function for a gp and performing fully bayesian prediction with a deep neural network. in this work, we derive this correspondence and develop a computationally efficient pipeline to compute the covariance functions. we then use the resulting gp to perform bayesian inference for deep neural networks on mnist and cifar-10. we find that the gp-based predictions are competitive and can outperform neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent. we observe that the trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the corresponding gp-based computation with increasing layer width, and that the gp uncertainty is strongly correlated with prediction error. we connect our observations to the recent development of signal propagation in random neural networks. h/t  laurent             join the  compressivesensing subreddit  or the  google+ community

study the sample complexity of learning neural networks, by providing new bounds on their rademacher complexity assuming norm constraints on the parameter matrix of each layer. compared to previous

its applications, quantization of signal measurements, as integrated into any realistic sensing model, impacts the quality of signal reconstruction. in fact, there even exist incompatible combinations of quantization functions (e.g., the 1-bit sign function) and sensing matrices (e.g., bernoulli) that cannot lead to an arbitrarily low reconstruction error when the number of observations increases. this work shows that, for a scalar and uniform quantization, provided that a uniform random vector, or \"random dithering\", is added to the compressive measurements of a low-complexity signal (e.g., a sparse or compressible signal, or a low-rank matrix) before quantization, a large class of random matrix constructions known to respect the restricted isometry property (rip) are made \"compatible\" with this quantizer. this compatibility is demonstrated by the existence of (at least) one signal reconstruction method, the \"projected back projection\" (pbp), whose reconstruction error is proved to decay when the number of quantized measurements increases. despite the simplicity of pbp, which amounts to projecting the back projection of the compressive observations (obtained from their multiplication by the adjoint sensing matrix) onto the low-complexity set containing the observed signal, we also prove that given a rip matrix and for a single realization of the dithering, this reconstruction error decay is also achievable uniformly for the sensing of all signals in the considered low-complexity set. we finally confirm empirically these observations in several sensing contexts involving sparse signals, low-rank matrices, and compressible signals, with various rip matrix constructions such as sub-gaussian random matrices and random partial discrete cosine transform (dct) matrices.                                                                    join the  compressivesensing subreddit  or the  google+ community  or the  facebook page  and post there !      liked

school \"statistical physics and machine learning back together\" that will take place in cargese, corsica, france during august 20-31, 2018. please forward this to your colleagues/students that may be interested.  researchers, students and postdocs interested to participate in the event are invited to apply on the website\u00a0 http://cargese.krzakala.org  (or  http://www.lps.ens.fr/~krzakala/website_cargese2018/home.htm  ) by february 28st, 2018.  the capacity of the cargese amphitheatre is limited, due to this constraint participants will be selected from the applicants.  the main goal of this event is to gather the community of researchers working on questions that relate in some way statistical physics and high dimensional statistical inference and learning. the format will be several (~10) 3h introductory lectures, and about thrice as many invited talks.  the topics include:  energy/loss landscapes in disordered systems, machine learning and

      dear colleagues and friends,  this is the announcement and call for participants of the workshop and advanced school \"statistical physics and machine learning back together\" that will take place in cargese, corsica, france during august 20-31, 2018. please forward this to your colleagues/students that may be interested.  researchers, students and postdocs interested to participate in the event are invited to apply on the website\u00a0 http://cargese.krzakala.org  (or  http://www.lps.ens.fr/~krzakala/website_cargese2018/home.htm  ) by february 28st, 2018.  the capacity of the cargese amphitheatre is limited, due to this constraint participants will be selected from the applicants.  the main goal of this event is to gather the community of researchers working on questions that relate in some way statistical physics and high dimensional statistical inference and learning. the format will be several (~10) 3h introductory lectures, and about thrice as many invited talks.  the topics include:  energy/loss landscapes in disordered systems, machine learning and inference problems    computational and statistical thresholds and trade-offs    theory of artificial multilayer neural networks    rigorous approaches to spin glasses and related models of statistical inference    parallels between optimisation algorithms and dynamics in physics    vindicating the replica and cavity method rigorously    current trends in variational bayes inference\u00a0    developments in message passing algorithms\u00a0    applications on machine learning in physics    information

random weights for texture generation in one layer neural networks \u00a0by\u00a0 mihir mongia ,\u00a0 kundan kumar ,\u00a0 akram erraqabi ,\u00a0 yoshua bengio   recent work in the literature has shown experimentally that one can use the lower layers of a trained convolutional neural network (cnn) to model natural textures. more interestingly, it has also been experimentally shown that only one layer with random filters can also model textures although with less variability. in this paper we ask the question as to why one layer cnns with random filters are so effective in generating textures? we theoretically show that one layer convolutional architectures (without a non-linearity) paired with the an energy function used in previous literature, can in fact preserve and modulate frequency coefficients in a manner so that random weights and pretrained weights will generate the same type of images. based on the results of this analysis we question whether similar properties hold in the case where one uses one convolution layer with a non-linearity. we show that in the case of relu non-linearity there are situations where only one input will give the minimum possible energy whereas in the case of no nonlinearity, there are always infinite solutions that will give the minimum possible energy. thus we can show that in certain situations adding a relu non-linearity generates less variable images.                                        join the  compressivesensing subreddit  or the  google+ community  or the  facebook page  and post there !      liked this entry

and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations. however, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. in this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks and convolutional lstms. more precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. we demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. we test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the musicnet dataset and on speech spectrum prediction using the timit dataset. we achieve state-of-the-art performance on these audio-related tasks.   implementation is here:\u00a0

weights in the whole cnndecnn architecture, we can still capture the geometric positions and contours of the image. the shape reduction of feature maps takes responsibility for the randomness on the reconstructed images for higher layer representation due to the representation compression. and random weight decnn can reconstruct robust images if we have enough number of feature maps          understanding deep representations through random weights \u00a0by\u00a0 yao shu ,\u00a0 man zhu ,\u00a0 kun he ,\u00a0 john hopcroft ,\u00a0 pan zhou      we systematically study the deep representation of random weight cnn (convolutional neural network) using the decnn (deconvolutional neural network) architecture. we first fix the weights of an untrained cnn, and for each layer of its feature representation, we train a corresponding decnn to reconstruct the input image. as compared with the pre-trained cnn, the decnn trained on a random weight cnn can reconstruct images more quickly and accurately, no matter which type of random distribution for the cnns weights. it reveals that every layer of the random cnn can retain photographically accurate information about the image. we then let the decnn be untrained, i.e. the overall cnn-decnn architecture uses only random weights. strikingly, we can reconstruct all position information of the image for low layer representations but the colors change. for high layer representations, we can still capture the rough contours of the image. we also change the number of feature maps and the shape of the feature maps and gain more insight on the random function of the cnn-decnn structure. our work reveals that the purely random cnn-decnn architecture substantially contributes to the geometric and photometric invariance due to the intrinsic symmetry and invertible structure, but it discards the colormetric information due to the random projection.                          join the  compressivesensing

order to obtain them, i developed together with nicolas macris a new adaptive interpolation method well designed for treating high-dimensironl bayesian inference problems.  _in this article we present our method with application to random linear estimation/compressive sensing as well as to symmetric low-rank matrix factorization and tensor factorization.   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02780.pdf   _in this one, presented at allerton this year, we present a nice application of the method to the non-symmetric tensor factorization problem that was resisting until now. moreover we exploit the structure in \u00ab layers \u00bb of the model, which might be an idea of independent interest.   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.10368.pdf   _finally, our main recent result is the application of the method for proving the statistical physics conjecture for the single-letter \u00ab replica formula \u00bb for the mutual information of generalized linear models. there we also rigorously derive the inference and generalization errors of a large class of single layer neural networks such as the perceptron.   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03395.pdf   all the best        thanks\u00a0 jean , here are the papers you mentioned. i had mentioned  one before \u00a0and i like the layer approach of the second paper !                 the stochastic interpolation method: a simple scheme to prove replica formulas in bayesian inference  by\u00a0 jean barbier ,  nicolas macris      in recent years important progress has been achieved towards proving the validity of the replica predictions for the (asymptotic) mutual information (or \"free energy\") in bayesian inference problems. the proof techniques that have emerged appear to be quite general, despite they have been worked out on a case-by-case basis. unfortunately, a common point between all these schemes is their relatively high level of technicality. we present a new proof scheme that is quite straightforward with respect to the previous ones. we call it the stochastic interpolation method because it can be seen as an extension of the interpolation method developped by guerra and toninelli in the context of spin glasses, with a trial \"parameter\" which becomes a stochastic process. in order to illustrate our method we show how to prove the replica formula for three non-trivial inference problems. the first one is symmetric rank-one matrix estimation (or factorisation), which is the simplest problem considered here and the one for which the method is presented in full details. then we generalize to symmetric tensor estimation and random linear estimation. in addition, we show how to prove a tight lower bound for the mutual information of non-symmetric tensor estimation. we believe that the present method has a much wider range of applicability and also sheds new insights on the reasons for the validity of replica formulas in bayesian inference.      the layered structure of tensor estimation and its mutual information  by\u00a0 jean barbier ,  nicolas macris ,  l\u00e9o miolane   we consider rank-one non-symmetric tensor esti- mation and derive simple formulas for the mutual information. we start by the order 2 problem, namely matrix factorization. we treat it completely in a simpler fashion than previous proofs using a new type of interpolation method developed in [1]. we then show how to harness the structure in \"layers\" of tensor estimation in order to obtain a formula for the mutual information for the order 3 problem from the knowledge of the formula for the order 2 problem, still using the same kind of interpolation. our proof technique straightforwardly general- izes and allows to rigorously obtain the mutual information at any order in a recursive way.            phase transitions, optimal errors and optimality of message-passing in generalized linear models  by\u00a0 jean barbier ,  florent krzakala ,  nicolas macris ,  l\u00e9o miolane ,  lenka zdeborov\u00e1   we consider generalized linear models (glms) where an unknown n-dimensional signal vector is observed through the application of a random matrix and a non-linear (possibly probabilistic) componentwise output function. we consider the models in the high-dimensional limit, where the observation consists of m points, and m/n\u2192\u03b1 where \u03b1 stays finite in the limit m,n\u2192\u221e. this situation is ubiquitous in applications ranging from supervised machine learning to signal processing. a substantial amount of theoretical work analyzed the model-case when the observation matrix has i.i.d. elements and the components of the ground-truth signal are taken independently from some known distribution. while statistical physics provided number of explicit conjectures for special cases of this model, results existing for non-linear output functions were so far non-rigorous. at the same time glms with non-linear output functions are used as a basic building block of powerful multilayer feedforward neural networks. therefore rigorously establishing the formulas conjectured for the mutual information is a key open problem that we solve in this paper. we also provide an explicit asymptotic formula for the optimal generalization error, and confirm the prediction of phase transitions in glms. analyzing the resulting formulas for several non-linear output functions, including the rectified linear unit or modulus functions, we obtain quantitative descriptions of information-theoretic limitations of high-dimensional inference. our proof technique relies on a new version of the interpolation method with an adaptive interpolation path and is of independent interest. furthermore we show that a polynomial-time algorithm referred to as generalized approximate message-passing reaches the optimal generalization error for a large set of parameters.                                         join the  compressivesensing subreddit  or the  google+ community  or

( https://nuit-blanche.blogspot.de/2017/12/compressive-3d-ultrasound-imaging-using.html ) and read it with great interest. thank you very much for highlighting this important contribution! i have been working on the incorporation of cs into ultrasound imaging for several years now ( https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=x35rubaaaaaj&hl=de ) and independently discovered a very similar method for high-frame rate ultrasound imaging (ui). instead of minimizing the number of sensors, this method aims at minimizing the number of sequential pulse-echo measurements per image. it emits three types of random ultrasonic waves to reduce the coherence of the sound waves scattered by distinct basis functions, e.g. point-like scatterers or fourier basis functions. the synthesis of these waves exploits the degrees of freedom provided by modern ui systems combined with planar transducer arrays. specifically, it leverages random time delays, random apodization weights, and combinations thereof. (in essence, the method electronically realizes the fixed coding mask used by kruizinga et al. as one type of random incident ultrasonic wave.) arxiv.org provides a preprint of this work:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00205   i hope that my method appeals to you and the readers of your blog. it would also mean a lot to me, if you mentioned this work on occasion.  happy new year and keep up your good work         thank you\u00a0 martin \u00a0! here is the paper:          random incident sound waves for fast compressed pulse-echo ultrasound imaging  by\u00a0 martin f. schiffner      a novel method for the fast acquisition and the recovery of ultrasound images disrupts the tradeoff between the image acquisition rate and the image quality. it recovers the spatial compressibility fluctuations in weakly-scattering soft tissue structures from only a few sequential pulse-echo measurements of the scattered sound field. the underlying linear inverse scattering problem uses a realistic d-dimensional physical model for the pulse-echo measurement process, accounting for diffraction, the combined effects of power-law absorption and dispersion, and the specifications of a planar transducer array. postulating the existence of a nearly-sparse representation of the spatial compressibility fluctuations in a suitable orthonormal basis, the compressed sensing framework ensures its stable recovery by a sparsity-promoting \u2113q-minimization method, if the pulse-echo measurements of the individual basis functions are sufficiently incoherent. the novel method meets this condition by leveraging the degrees of freedom in the syntheses of the incident ultrasonic waves. it emits three types of random ultrasonic waves that outperform the widely-used steered quasi-plane waves (qpws). their synthesis applies random time delays, apodization weights, or combinations thereof to the voltage signals exciting the individual elements of the planar transducer array.                   join the  compressivesensing subreddit  or the  google+ community  or the  facebook page  and post there !         liked this entry ? subscribe to nuit blanches feed, theres
