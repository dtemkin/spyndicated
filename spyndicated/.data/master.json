{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "is_blog": false, "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/irgXK6ziw54", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-14 10:11:00", "summary": "on monday, amazon  reportedly  began a series of rare layoffs at its headquarters in seattle, cutting several hundred corporate employees. but this week, something quite different is happening at the companys warehouses and customer-service centers across the country: amazon will politely ask its associatesfull-time and part-time hourly employeesif theyd prefer to quit. and if they do, amazon will pay them as much as $5,000 for walking out the door.  officially called the offer, this proposition is, according to amazon, a way to encourage unhappy employees to move on. we believe staying somewhere you dont want to be isnt healthy for our employees or for the company, ashley robinson, an amazon spokesperson, wrote to me in an email. the amount full-time employees get offered ranges from $2,000 to $5,000, and depends on how long they have been at the company; if they take the money, they agree to never work for amazon again. (the idea for all this  originated  at zappos, the online shoe retailer that amazon bought in 2009.)  considering that amazon  reportedly  already has high turnoverit is a famously efficient company that asks a lot of its workersit may seem surprising that it would incentivize workers to walk away. many employees at amazons warehouses,  as ive written before , say that they are constantly pressured to work harder and faster (and get fired if they dont), and that the jobs are physically and psychologically grueling.  when i asked amazon about these workers complaints, the company said that the top priority of its fulfillment centers is the success and well-being of its employees. no worker is ever dismissed without good reason, robinson told me. and as the company grows, she added, it is strongly in our interests to retain existing employees. but that just makes the offer seem more puzzling. if amazon wants to retain employees, why would it pay them to leave?  with the offer, amazon seems to be making the calculation that weeding out a single unengaged worker is worth as much as multiple thousands of dollars. but there might be other, less obvious effects of providing the offer that serve to benefit amazon, according to some behavioral economists. the offer might in fact be a way to make employees stay longer than they otherwise might.  the reasoning goes like this: employees resist an initial temptationto quit amazon and walk out with cashand by resisting it, they may actually feel more committed to their jobs, said ian ayres, a professor at yale law school who wrote about the concept of the offer in his book  carrots and sticks: unlock the power of incentives to get things done . amazon employees who evaluate the offer and then turn it down have decided they like the company enough to stay a little longer. they then want their future behavior to match that feeling, ayres said.  when i talked to katherine milkman, a professor at the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania, she brought up a similar idea, from the realm of social psychology. she talked about the mental pressure humans feel to resolve cognitive dissonanceif people have two conflicting beliefs, theyll try to rationalize one to make it fit with the other. in this case, workers may dislike their jobs at amazon, but if they turn down the offer, it means they passed on a chance to quit. its likely that theyll then try to convince themselves that they actually like working at amazon, milkman said. to pick a more extreme example of this phenomenon, when people join a cult that says the world is going to end on a certain date and then it doesnt end,   they tend to  end up believing more strongly in the cult , because they cant put up with the cognitive dissonance between what they believe and what actually happened.  milkman also brought up escalation of commitment, another concept studied by behavioral economists. the idea is that when people put a lot of money or effort into something and it appears to be going badlyperhaps they bought a stock and the share price is tankingthey often double down on their commitment. they say, \u2018i want to see this turn aroundi dont want it to turn out badly, milkman said. when employees see that theyve lost $5,000 by not taking the offer, they might mentally recommit to the company, trying to do better at their jobs and enjoy them more.  amazon is just one of dozens of companies (many of them tech firms) that are looking for ways to use behavioral-economics findings to try to make their companies run more efficiently, and, in some cases, make their employees happier and healthier. google, for instance, has conducted a  number of experiments  in its cafeterias to nudge employees toward eating vegetables or cutting down on the number of m&ms they consume. (maya shankar, who had founded the social and behavioral sciences team in the obama white house, now runs a behavioral-science division at google.) uber  uses digital nudges in its app  to try and motivate its drivers to pick up more fares and work longer hours. i think companies are recognizing that theres a lot to be learned from research about how to build smart incentive systems and use behavioral science to design tools that arent just cash, said milkman.  an important caveat about the offer is thatregardless of how it may register in an employees mindthe people who do take it dont actually walk away with $5,000. a big chunk of the payment is taxed, and employees who might have received benefits (in the form of 401(k) contributions or shares of stock) if they stayed to a certain date might not be around long enough for those benefits to vest. john burgett, a current amazon employee who has worked various positions in a warehouse in indiana since 2014 and blogs about his experiences at  amazon emancipatory , estimated that if he took the offer in early 2017, he would have received a $3,000 payout. but he says he also would have lost a portion of his 401(k), which would not vest until he had been with the company for three continuous years, and also would have lost four shares of amazon stock that would not vest until the summer of 2017. he also figured the company can pay a new employee less than it pays him, since he has received a few raises over the years. (at the time of his calculations, he made $13 an hour.) ive considered it, but ive always said its a bad deal, he told me.  behavioral economics aside, part of amazons reasoning for issuing the offer is probably straightforward: it wants to prod unhappy employees to leave. and each year, some peoplea small percentage, according to amazondo take the company up on it. they include jim perota, who is now 60, and worked for amazons distribution center in chattanooga for three years. he says he hated the job. he says he lost 30 pounds working at amazon because he was on his feet so much, picking items off shelves and putting them in bins, and also packing goods into boxes. his breaks were only 15 minutes, but it would take 10 minutes to get to the break room, so hed sit on stairs, waiting for the work to begin again, he told me. perota had worked for the postal service, as a disc jockey, and for the u.s. census, but working for amazon was the most brutal, and it took the biggest toll on my body, he said. but he couldnt quit, because he needed the health insurance, he said.  but then obamacare came to tennessee. in 2014, amazon presented the offer to employees at perotas warehouse on a tuesday in march. on thursday of that week, perota signed up for obamacare. on friday, he took the offer and quit his job. it was one of the best decisions he ever made, he said. i felt pretty liberated when i walked out those doors for the last time, he said. he now works as a nighttime security guard.  in the end, the offer wasnt a financial boon for perota. he received $3,000 from the company, but says he more or less broke even because the money was taxed heavily, and he lost the employer contributions in his 401(k), because he had not been with the company long enough to walk away with it. but that didnt matter, he told me. what mattered was that he got out.", "kwds": ["on", "monday", "amazon", " ", "reportedly", " ", "began", "series", "of", "rare", "layoffs", "at",

(meagan flynn / the atlantic)   houston has developed other vertical-farm concepts in the past two years. theres space city farms, a backyard aeroponic vertical garden; dream harvest, a hydroponic system similar to moonflower; and acre in a box, a literal take on the operation housed in a shipping container.  acre in a boxs foundersandrew abendshein, who works for an oil and gas trading firm in houston, and ana buckman, a rice university languages and creative-writing instructorhad no background in agriculture when they invested $80,000 in their first shipping-container farm. abendshein said he has long had an interest in getting fresh produce to urban food deserts and hopes to one day start moving shipping-container vertical farms into those neighborhoods. for now, though, acre in a boxs two farms are hidden in the parking lot of an abandoned drill-bit factory at the end of a dead-end street in houstons east downtown, a few blocks from where houstons two largest bayous intersect.    harvey, and the deluge it brought, are exactly the kind of scenario that vertical farms are designed to withstand. catastrophic flooding events like harvey are only expected to become  more frequent , and threats of food and water scarcity are projected to worsen in the years to comeall as the population grows. the united nations  projects that the worlds population will be 9.8 billion by 2050 , with  roughly two-thirds of those people living in urban areas , which arent exactly conducive to large-scale farming.  to meet the growing demand for food, the uns food and agriculture organization estimates that there needs to be a  50 percent increase  in global agriculture productiona distinct challenge, the un warns, in the face of climate change and the growing need for water conservation. vertical farms present a potential solution: there is no fertilizer runoff into the groundwater, fewer co2 emissions from delivery trucks long journeys, and no land to till. they require only a fraction of the acreage and use only a fraction of the wateranywhere from  90  to  97 percent  lessthat traditional farms do.  we are kind of at the beginning of a revolution, per pinstrup-andersen, a graduate-school professor at cornell universitys college of human ecology, told me. were at the beginning of a very rapid development in the use of indoor controlled facilities for producing vegetables and some fruits, he said. no matter what happens with climate change, you still have your controlled environment.  the technology used for these farms has been around for decades. in fact, marques began studying it in the 1990s after learning that nasa used it to grow plants in space. but only in the last several years has interest in using the technology for urban, commercial-scale agriculture picked up. indoor farms have recently sprouted up in old warehouses, shipping containers, and small skyscrapers in new jersey, south korea, germany, india, and dubaiplaces where traditional farming is either difficult or impossible due to climate, population density, or the land itself. in houston, sprawling commercial and residential developments were built on top of a swamp, making large-scale outdoor farming virtually impossible.  marques and i hopped in his minivan and headed about a mile away from his garden to the site of the moonflower farms expansion, where men in hard hats were surveying the land. the new facility doesnt look like much yetjust a large elevated mound of dirt with metal poles sticking out of it. but by the time its operational, marques plans to have a 20,000-square-foot greenhouse that he expects will churn out 1,000 pounds of produce per daycompared with the 20 pounds that his tiny facility produces now. he currently sells to a couple dozen restaurants but plans to expand to regional and national distributors and local grocers once the new facility is up and running.  the elimination of long, cross-country transports to get the produce to grocery stores means consumers wind up with fresher food. right now, marques said, the time from harvest to table is sometimes only a matter of hours, which means that produce arrives in better shape and then lasts longer both in the store and in peoples homes. if we can make this work in the city of houston and produce 1,000 pounds a day or more of producthigh-quality product that has three times the shelf lifethen we have a good model that we can pretty much [take] to any city in the world and replicate, marques said.  the new greenhouse will operate like a research-and-development facility, helping marques perfect a prototype that interested farmers around the world can use as a template. he already knows that hell need to make some changes. for starters, hes not going to rely exclusively on led lighting as he does now; instead he will mostly use sunlight, plugging in energy-efficient lighting as a supplementa measure that will cut costs significantly. marques said he has already had inquiries about this model from a food distributor in cairo, where  the arid climate and heavy reliance on imported crops  make the food supply  unpredictable . marques says he has also talked to strawberry growers in norway, where thousands of metric tons of strawberries  are imported  every year due to the short growing season. and he has heard from cattle farmers in brazil, where  the shrinking availability of pastureland  and  prohibitions on razing rainforests  mean that some farmers may need to import grass to feed their cows.    ana buckman, acre in a boxs cfo, shows off kale that was later sent off to local businesses in houston. (meagan flynn / the atlantic)   cutting the costs of building and maintaining the systems themselves will be crucial as vertical farms continue to evolve, according to henry gordon-smith, the co-founder of the international association for vertical farming and a consultant at the new york\u2013based firm agritecture. as a result of high costs, gordon-smith said, several vertical farms in north america have failed in recent years. thats what happened at localgarden, a rooftop vertical farm in vancouver that went bankrupt in 2014, and at podponics, a shipping-container vertical farm in atlanta, where high labor and technology costs were consistently undermining return on investment.  mike nasseri, who was the harvest supervisor at localgarden, said that design flaws had inflated the endeavors operational and energy costs to the point that the farm couldnt make enough money. even though the farm had started small, nasseri said the crew decided to scale up too quickly to a commercial operation. to make matters worse, nasseri said, the costs of the real estate in the middle of downtown vancouvera central location he said he would not recommend for new vertical farmers were way too high. that placement [in the middle of downtown] is basically the first way you can screw up, nasseri said.  still, hes a major proponent of vertical farming, primarily because of its environmental benefits. hes now working at a startup called ava technologies, developing indoor smart gardens, essentially mini vertical farms that can fit on kitchen counters.  gordon-smith said the industry-wide goal going forward has to be to minimize the risk of failure, financial or otherwise, as much as possible in order to make vertical farming more accessible to the younger generation of produce growers, who have been  moving steadily away   from rural areas  and toward cities over the past few decades. still, he said, the failures serve as lessons for new investors as they continue to develop various types of vertical farms.  like marques, abendshein, the founder of acre in a box, was stuck at home monitoring his produce from the couch during harvey. but he knew he could rest assured that, as the waters raged, his produce was safe. without land that could be ruined for an entire season, the worst that could happen, he thought, was that his farms would float away.", "kwds":

dow jones industrial average has fallen by 1,000 points only twice in its 122-year history. the first time was monday. the second was thursday.  there are two points to make about this. first,  stocks have had a miserable week . the dow erased nearly $3 trillion in wealth with a 10 percent plunge that officially qualifies as whats called a market correction.  second,  stocks have had a marvelous decade . the dow has thousands of points to lose because it has accumulated thousands of points in the last few years, quadrupling since 2009. with this latest collapse, the index of 30 stocks has fallen way, way back to levels not glimpsed since the dystopian hellscape of  thanksgiving 2017.  so, whats this all about? the stock market is a synthesis of stories about the future, a global anthology of investors financial predictions. when stocks rise steadily with little volatilityas they have for the last few yearsit suggests widespread agreement on the worlds economic narrative. for a long time, the story went that corporate profits were rising in global unison for the first time in years, as both inflation and interest rates stayed low, creating a relatively risk-free environment for equities.  then, rather suddenly, the story changed. on friday of last week, the bureau of labor statistics announced that wages had grown by 2.9 percent over the previous 12 months, a record high for the current expansion. this seems to have triggered fears that higher wages chasing a finite number of goods and services would lead to higher prices and furthermore that higher prices would encourage the federal reserve to raise interest rates to combat inflation.  just as low interest rates had buoyed stock prices for years, the fear of rising interest rates has the opposite effect, inspiring a flight to safety as traders switch from stocks to fixed-income investments, such as government bonds. as investors scrambled to move money from equities to bonds, many traders who had bet against this sort of volatilitythrough a ( now controversial ) financial instrument, called xiv, that essentially allowed people to place wagers on continued calmness in the marketswere nearly wiped out. it all led to the worst nominal loss in the history of the dow.  and that was just monday. on tuesday and wednesday, stocks whirled like a plastic bag in a hurricane, at one point recovering most of their losses. then, on thursday, everything fell apart all over again in the midst of a crowded news cycle, as chinas trade surplus  narrowed , and republicans announced their plan to pass a deficit-swelling budget.  the significance of this weeks market gyrations can be stated simply: there is no reason to believe that this is the beginning a global financial crisis. nor is there reason to believe this is the foreshadowing of a u.s. recession. assigning monocausal blame for soaring or plunging stocks is a rough business, but what happened this week is in all likelihood a tizzy over inflation.  but if markets are afraid of inflation, they are fearing a ghost. ever since the 2008 financial crisis, warnings of incipient inflation have been  both persistent and wrong . the federal reserve has routinely aimed for 2 percent inflation in the years following the housing crash, and its aim has been routinely low. in 2016 and 2017, wage growth accelerated for lower-income americans. but annual growth in core personal-consumption expendituresthe feds most commonly used inflation measurewas  1.7 and 1.5 percent  in those years. wages perked up a bit. prices didnt.  if investors are afraid of the feds approach to inflation, it is ironic that this seasons research note from the federal reserve bank of st. louis is titled  why is inflation so low?  the u.s. inflation rate has been below the feds 2 percent inflation target since 2012, the paper begins, going on to cite several reasons to be concerned about very low inflation, such as the risk of a recession caused by falling prices, or deflation. this isnt a purely american phenomenon, either. the world has been trapped for years in a steady state of low price growth. in 2017, annual inflation across the rich countries that make up the organization for economic cooperation and development was  j  ust 1.7 percent .  is this story about to change? nobody knows. but one data point of 2.9 percent wage growth is just that: one point of data. its  not proof  that wages are taking off. its certainly not proof that accelerating wage growth is driving up prices. for now, its just a statistic, yet it seems to have helped trigger a frenzy of fear across global markets that inflationthat ever-feared and never-appeared boogeymanwill finally materialize.  for years, stock prices have inflated in part due to constraints on labor costs. now at the slightest sign that labor costs might themselves be inflating, equities seem to be crashing for fear the central banks might rein in their support of economic growth. thats quite a shame. if investors are wary of central bankers because they think bankers are wary of labors gains, it sets up a dynamic where capital specifically defines risk-free success by its capacity to restrain the prospects of labor. capitalism may be the best flawed economic system out there, but is it any wonder that  more americans are starting to doubt that its working ?",

 announced  on thursday that certain members of its prime subscription program can order whole foods items to be delivered within two hours. the program debuts this week in several neighborhoods in austin, dallas, virginia beach, and cincinnati. delivery is free for orders over $35not exactly a challenge at a store nicknamed whole paycheckwith a  $4.99 charge for cheaper purchases . desperate dinner-party hosts can expedite one-hour delivery of fresh produce for $7.99, in many cases less than the cost of an uber to the grocery store and back.  when amazon  spent $14 billion on whole foods  last year in its largest-ever acquisition, many analysts saw three obvious advantages for the retail giant. first, its ceo, jeff bezos, would amazon-ify whole foods, cutting the prices of popular items to increase foot traffic and overall revenue. second, amazon would use whole foods 400-plus upper-middle-class locations as distribution nodes for a range of products. third, the company would try to turn whole foods into an online-retail company, by allowing households to order food on smartphones (or via a smart speaker like the amazon echo) and have fresh produce dropped off at their doorstep, just like they would a book or a toothbrush.  the analysts were right. amazon is doing all of the above cutting prices  and leveraging whole foods locations to build an on-demand food-delivery service. and that on-demand food-and-meal delivery service may be  set to take off . a study commissioned by the market-research firm euromonitor  projected  that the market for such services will grow 15 times faster than the restaurant business through the end of this decade. and this might just be the beginning. greg greeley, amazons head of prime, is transitioning to a new position overseeing whole foods integration into the company, cnbc has  reported .  it would be a mistake to treat every amazon announcement as an amazon  accomplishment . on-demand whole foods delivery could turn out to be a giant mess. indeed, amazon has struggled with grocery-delivery services before,  shutting down  its amazon fresh program in several cities last year. six months from now, the dominant news story about whole foods prime could be a wave of anecdotes about overwhelmed whole foods workers in virginia beach or cincinnati, or tales of zucchini that arrived so lukewarm and smushed as to resemble ratatouille. execution matters, and excellent execution isnt an inevitability, even for a logistics master like amazon.  but it would be a bigger mistake to analyze thursdays news in a vacuum, because this announcement is bigger than heirloom tomatoes and two-hour delivery windows. in the broader context of amazons ambitionsto build an  operating system  for the home, to expand into  pharmacies  and  health care , to become a hit-making  television production studio this is the logical next step in turning prime into the ultimate life bundle, a single membership program to bind consumers to every possible commercial need. as amazon extends into more product areas, it can own both the search platform and the product, so that when a dad says to the smart speaker on his counter, alexa, i need brown rice and pork, the product that arrives is an amazon-branded box containing amazon\u2013whole foods\u2013branded rice and pork.  this sort of vertical integration is invaluable for amazon. for one thing, the creation of an on-demand whole foods product makes the companys prime subscription more valuable. enriching prime is arguably amazons most important goal, given the lifetime value of a prime subscriber. whats more, as amazon becomes the top-of-mind destination for not only books but also toiletries, medicine, and chicken breasts, it becomes the first-stop destination for all of its customers searches.  and what comes with search volume? advertising. indeed, amazons ad businesswhich includes  sponsored ads on alexa , suggested items on amazon search pages, and even ad boxes around the internet on other sites   grew 60 percent last quarter , faster than googles or facebooks, albeit from a lower base. the business is on track to make as much as $10 billion in revenue by the end of this year, or about one-quarter of facebooks total revenue in 2017. as amazon draws more consumers into its orbit, it will also pull competitors into a deflationary cycle: each time the company enters a new industry,  like those for grocery stores or pharmacies , the stock valuations of the sectors largest companies decline, as investors anticipate that amazon will pull down the industrys profits to zero in order to draw in consumers and maximize cash flow.  amazon was a fascinating buyer for whole foods for just this reason. it is the anti\u2013whole foods, forever evincing a no-frills obsession with low prices and absolute convenience over artisanal touches. and yet, the two companies are perfect partners. whole foods became a kind of cult for its most devoted customers, who sacrificed their weekly food budget on the altar of artisanal produce. jeff bezoss ultimate ambition is similarly cultish: to build a pan-commercial enterprise, where every consumer question is best answered by first asking amazon. the company is a leveraged bet on  absolute customer convenience . and nothing says absolute customer convenience like yelling the word  kale!  at a box in ones living room and finding fresh greens on ones doorstep within 120 minutes.", "kwds": ["amazon", " ", "announced", " ", "on", "thursday", "that",

wednesday morning, president donald trumpchief executive of a $19 trillion economy, leader of the free world, commander of a nuclear military forcefinally weighed in on the stock markets sudden decline, by arguing with it. in the \u2018old days, when good news was reported, the stock market would go up, he wrote  on twitter . today, when good news is reported, the stock market goes down. big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!  there is at least one thing he is right about: the stock market is indeed in a slump. for the past few days, indices from around the world have been in various states of free fall, correction, surge, and panic, with the dow jones industrial average experiencing its biggest-ever one-day point drop on monday, nasdaq halting trades in a few  financial instruments  linked to market volatility, and  apocalyptic  headlines  piling up . animal spirits, in the memorable phrasing of the economist john maynard keynes, are loose.  trump is right about another thing too: the u.s. does have so much good (great) news about the economy at the moment. every developed economy on earth is  growing right now , for the first time in a decade. corporate earnings are coming in higher than expected this season, and the jobs market is  potentially close  to full employment. the major  leading indicators  continue to look good, as well, dampening fears of an imminent correction or recession.  but his tweet evinces both a prurient interest in the market and a lack of knowledge about its gyrations. the stock market is not a reflection of the true state of the economy. it does not always go up as the economy strengthens, or decline as the economy falls. and no one, save for some day traders and investors with a very short time horizon, need to spend much time worrying what it is doing or whyat least not for now.  in trumps formulation, financial markets have a simplistic, monocausal relationship with economic data: good news, markets up; bad news, markets down. in reality, though, financial markets have an obtuse, metaphysical relationship with economic data: good news, who knows; bad news, who knows.   as a very general point, the markets do tend to drift in  the same direction  as the economy. recessions tend to come with declines in the standard & poors 500 (a  far better index  to keep an eye on than the dow jones, by the way). expansions tend to come with bull markets. but the financial markets tend to be vastly more volatile than headline economic figuresand that is true even in the long period of unusually  low volatility  that appeared to end late last week. an economy growing 2 percent a year might see market surges of 2 percent a day, or swift year-on-year growth of 10 percent.  plus, on a day-to-day level, good economic news does not cleanly translate into a higher market, nor does bad news translate into a worse one. financial traders take in a huge number of economic and financial variables. they bet on what the other guy knows. they signal. they hedge. they construct algorithms to seek out strange correlations. as such, in the short term, it tends to be surprising newsnot good or bad newsthat forces market movements. and sometimes it is no news at all.  indeed, it is often totally unclear what causes a given surge or sell-off. trump was trumpeting the theory that better-than-expected jobs and wage numbers raised concerns about rising inflation and tighter monetary policy. the u.s. federal reserve is raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating, ken griffin, the founder of the investment behemoth citadel, wrote in a note late last week, just as the market started to sour. we are particularly concerned about the nascent signs of accelerating inflation in many countries around the world, given the general complacency around the risks of an inflationary shock. but nobody knows for sure. perhaps the gyrations have to do with  interest rates . perhaps they have to do with rising wages cutting into  corporate profits . perhaps they have to do with  algorithmic trading . perhaps traders  are trolling  the new federal reserve chairman.  the important thingand the reason it seems that most americans can safely ignore the turbulenceis that the economic and business outlook remains rosy. global growth is secure for now; the federal reserve has telegraphed its intention to increase interest rates; businesses are competing for workers. it seems like people are pricing in that the tax cut is going to have more of a near-term stimulative effect then maybe we appreciated a few months ago, neel kashkari, the president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis, said in a  television interview  this week.  further, it would take a much more significant sell-off to mar the extraordinary bull run that has gone on for nearly a decade at this point. after the setbacks of the past few days, the dow jones is back where it was in decemberwhich is still far higher than it was when president trump took office, let alone when president barack obama took office. anyone with an investment horizon longer than a few weeks is likely to be firmly in the black, and anyone with an investment horizon longer than a few days would probably do well to ignore the headlines and flashing lights.  that goes for president trump, too. presidents have historically tried  to avoid  talking about these volatile investments, given that what goes up so often goes down, and given that what is good for traders and investors is not always good for workers. but this president touted that the market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value in his state of the union address, and argued that the reason our stock market is so successful is because of me a few months ago. that, to be clear, is not true either.", "kwds": ["on", "wednesday", "morning", "president", "donald", "trumpchief", "executive",

from highway billboards. they are ads.  but while the work of stealing attention might seem infinitely employable, something strange is happening behind the scenes of americas most inescapable industry. for the first time on record, the number of advertising-specific jobs in the u.s. is declining in the middle of an economic expansion, according to government data.  anyone following the  slow-motion meltdown  in the media industry in the last year might expect that advertising is suffering a similar downturn. but its a far more complicated story than that. for the last three decadesas far back as the relevant bureau of labor statistics dataset goesadvertising jobs have grown in line with the economy. today, however, a variety of traditional advertising jobs appear to be in recession mode. the number of jobs at ad agencies fell by about 5,000 last year, on net, while employment in media-buying agenciesfirms that tend to focus on advertising strategy rather than designing or filming commercialshasnt grown since 2013.     number of net jobs created annually in media and advertising, in thousands      data: bureau of labor statistics    whats going on? its certainly not a case of fewer advertisements. the typical american has gone from seeing about 500 ads each day in the 1970s to about 5,000 today,  according to a   common industry statistic  (and some  more-recent estimates  are much higher). that is one corporate message for roughly every 10 seconds of waking life.  instead, the mysterious decline can be explained by two developments, most prominently technologys invasion of the ad sector and the phenomenon of more corporations trying to emulate outside media companies in-house, which leaves less work for traditional ad firms.  first, there are facebook and google. they are the largest advertising companies in the worldand, quite likely, the largest in the history of the world. last year, 90 percent of the growth of the digital-advertising business went to just these two firms. facebook and google are so profitable because they use their enormous scale and data to deliver targeted advertising at a low cost. this has forced the worlds large advertising firms to preserve their profitability through  a series of mergers , accompanied by jobs cuts in the name of efficiency.  so what has been the effect of these tech companies on advertising employment? the bureau of labor statistics technically considers facebook and google to be  data processing  companies, rather than advertising companies. so, because of this label, what government records show is not that facebook and google have stopped hiring people in their advertising divisions, but rather that the growth of those divisions has caused the traditional advertising market to shrink.  the emergence of an advertising duopoly has coincided with the rise of programmatic advertising, a torpid term that essentially means companies using algorithms to buy and place ads in those little boxes all over the internet. as any  mad men  fan might intuit, advertising has long been a relationship-driven business, in which multimillion-dollar contracts are hammered out over one-on-one meetings, countless lunches, and even more-countless drinks. with programmatic technology, however, companies can buy access to specific audiences across several publishing platforms at once, bypassing the work of building relationships with each one. that process produces more ads and requires fewer peopleor, at least, fewer traditional advertising jobs and more technical jobs.  the old story about programmatic advertising was that both marketers and digital publishersthink aol, or any news siteembraced the technology, as it allowed companies to cheaply target specific audiences on a budget. but the new reality is that programmatic advertising has placed many advertisements in controversial places, next to low-quality news sources or outright offensive content. between 2016 and 2017, a survey by the association of national advertisers found that  a third of marketers cut back on media agencies  running programmatic ad campaigns. instead, brands brought those operations in-house, where they have more control over where their ads run and much more information about who actually sees them. the upshot: programmatic ads have been a double blow to media agencies, first automating their function and then encouraging companies to insource the work.  second, there is the merging of the advertising and entertainment businesses. as smartphone screens have edged out tv as the most important real estate for media, companies have invested more in branded contentcorporate-sponsored media, such as an article or video, that resembles traditional entertainment more than it does traditional advertising. some of the most prominent names in journalism, such as  the   new york times ,  buzzfeed ,  vice , and  the atlantic , are owned by companies that have launched their own branded-content shops, which operate as stand-alone divisions. as many media companies have tried to become more like advertising companies, the value of the average creative-account win, an ad-industry term for a new contract, has declined,  falling by about 40 percent  between 2016 and 2017.  so there are two major themes of the decline of advertising jobs, one that has to do with the companies that now create them and one that has to do with the way brands prefer to market themselves nowadays. in short, the future of the advertising business is being moved to technology companies managing ad networks and media companies making branded contentthat is, away from the ad agencies.", "kwds": ["they", "are", "everywhere", "singing", "jingles", "in", "living", "rooms", "lining",

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "is_blog": false, "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/JJsXMJocVKY", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-06 13:43:47", "summary": "by the end of the day on monday, the dow had  lost more than 1,100 points  since the markets had opened that morningits largest one-day drop ever. the days losses totalled up to around 4.6 percent percent of the indexs value, which is not insignificant, but also not unheard of: a drop of more than 3 percent followed brexit back in 2016. and mondays losses werent on anywhere near the scale of  black monday , a day in 1987 that earned its name from the erasure of more than 20 percent of the dows value.  watching the market tank, however precipitously, is always scary. thats probably why  several brokerage sites , such as fidelity and vanguard, crashed on tuesday, as frantic investors clamored to check their portfolios. but even as the dow slid in historic fashion, many analysts still werent panicking. why? theyve been expecting this type of adjustment for years.  for a moment on tuesday morning, the stock market was on the way up. then it plunged again, and continued to zig and zag as the day progressed. the dows roller-coaster-like performance may seem unusual and dramatic, but its actually just a somewhat abrupt restoration of a fairly normal feature of markets: volatility.  the stock market has been on a historic bull run, hitting several new highs with mostly uninterrupted growth. this impressive streak has allowed the dow to nearly quadruple since 2009. thats why the impact of mondays enormous slide has been nowhere near as big as that of the crash in 1987, even though the recent drop-off seems large.  during the most recent run, there have been only a few small and short-lived moments when that upward trajectory has been halted or reversed. (when these moments are especially dramaticwhen a major index loses 10 percent or more of its valueanalysts call them corrections.) historically, that type of uninterrupted growth isnt normal. in fact, the lack of market dips is what led some,  including donald trump at one time , to worry that perhaps a bubble was forming, and that stocks were artificially inflated.  most analysts agree that theres little evidence that a sizable bubble existsthat the markets have been on a tear because the economy has slowly and steadily been strengthening since the end of the great recession. since then, an improving labor market, higher corporate profits, and interest rates kept low by the fed have meant boom times for big businesses and the investors who poured their money into the markets. now, some of that may be changing, even if the fundamentals of the economy arent.  there have been plenty of theories about why the market has sunk, even though its considered difficult (if not impossible) to point to any single explanation. one of the more outlandish ideas is that the market is testing the feds new leader, jerome powell, but thats more conspiracy theory than reality. others suggest that recent political and economic shifts might be behind the losses. the january jobs report showed that average hourly earnings grew 2.9 percent over the past yearthe most significant growth since 2009. while thats great news for most americans, it could mean tighter profit margins for corporations. further, a strengthening economy could mean that the federal reserve chooses to raise rates more drastically than it has in the pastwhich would making securing credit and borrowing more expensive than they have been in years. as investors and business owners consider those potential changes, they could start making new calculations about where to put their money.  even as the markets continue to fluctuate wildly, and volatility persists, its important to remember that the economy has lately been full of good news. wages are growing, corporations are more profitable than ever, unemployment is low. while the most recent downturn might be unsettling, its actually pretty normal.", "kwds":

17:27:08", "summary": "the dow jones industrial average plunged more than 1,000 points on monday. this was the largest nominal decline in the history of the index, and the first time that the dow has lost more than a thousand points in a single day of trading.  this means the dow suffered its first-ever four-digit point loss just hours after the super bowl witnessed its first-ever four-digit offensive output. i am not suggesting causality herei am  insisting  on causality here.    thats a joke. but its no more serious than many of the attempts to explain the daily gyrations of the stock market, a public synthesis of millions of investment decisions by millions of people reacting to myriad news stories while guessing at the trading behavior of strangers they will never meet. stock nosedives such as this create a vacuum of chaos and confusion into which creative theories flood, often unhelpfully. for example, cnbc hosts reportedly  suggested  that the market was testing jerome powell, the new chairman of the federal reserve. it seems unlikely that institutional investors coordinated a trillion-dollar pop quiz for powell, just to test his reflexes.  there is a less creative explanation: there are some large-scale investors (such as brokerages with large accounts) that are nervous about incipient inflation due to clear signs of strong wage growth. these investors are also concerned that the federal reserve might raise rates, thus making it more expensive for companies to borrow and invest money. higher inflation, higher wage growth, and less corporate investment would mean smaller profits for corporations. since the stock market is fundamentally a collective bet on the future profitability of publicly traded companies, these factors would altogether predict that investors would be willing to pay less to own a share in a typical company than they were a week ago.  this shows that, unfortunately, wall street and main street do not always move forward in tandem. the stock market has soared in the last nine years, as slow wage growth has constrained labor costs for large corporations. but when wages rise quickly, that can threaten to eat into corporate profitability. on friday, the bureau of labor statistics reported that annual wage growth hit 2.9 percent, its highest figure of the current expansion. hours later, the dow  dropped precipitously .  mondays decline will certainly be terrifying to some investors, particularly if they just recently got into the market. trading activity on the website e*trade in november and december represented  two of the three best months in the companys history , suggesting that many retail investors have piled into the market recently. monday was a scary day for them, as well as anyone who was planning on soon cashing out any retirement savings theyd stockpiled in the market.  but there are severals reasons to withhold panic. first, while this is the largest points decline in dow history, there have been several worse days in the last 15 years by percentage terms,  including   september 17th, 2001, and september 29th, 2008 . second, even after mondays fall, the index is still higher than it was in november 2017.     the dow jones industrial average, february 2015\u2013february 2018      data: yahoo! finance    third, and most importantly, this has been one of the most astonishing bull markets in stock-market history. since march 2009, the dow has almost quadrupled in value. more recently, its historic last 12 months has been driven by  a strong global economic expansion  that should continue. as michael cembalest, the chairman of market and investment strategy at jp morgan,  told me   last fall , the percentage of countries in major expansion mode is about as good as it can get.  finally, president trump has  insisted  that the economy is a flawless report card that validates his tumultuous term. but the last two trading sessions demonstrate perfectly why its so dangerous to attach any presidential reputation to economic indicators. the thing about the stock market is it goes up and down, sometimes by eye-popping margins, and the president almost always has nothing to do with the final figure.", "kwds": ["the", "dow", "jones", "industrial", "average", "plunged", "more", "than", "1,000", "points", "on", "monday", "this", "was", "the", "largest",

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "is_blog": false, "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/F0mQCwZr4DA", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-05 13:00:00", "summary": "in march 2017 , the new york city\u2013based editors and writers of  the atlantic  moved to a wework office in brooklyn. i remember our first morning vividly: it was like entering the millennial id. craft beer and cucumber water poured from kitchen taps. laptoppers in jeans and toques clacked along to mgmt in the wood-paneled common area. a wework community manager showed us to a glass-walled office so small that my colleagues and i could clasp hands while seated. we sat. had we arrived in the future of work?     the atlantic  told us this arrangement would be temporary while our real office was renovated. as of this writing, were still here. if wework had its way, wed stay forever, along with much of the 21st-century workforce.  wework is the worlds leading co-working company and the sixth-most-valuable start-up, according to venturesource. last year it was valued at $20 billion, a staggering sum for a company renting out short-term office space, mostly to small businesses and freelancers. but like uber and airbnb, wework positions itself grandly, as a disruptive revolutionary. it promises to humanize work, making the office a more creative place, with the right lighting, the right snacks, and, crucially, the right people.  wework would say its well on its way to transforming white-collar labor: it seats 175,000 members in 207 locations across 20 countries, with plans to double in size this year. its leaders describe it not as a real-estate venture but as a community company.  whether thats a $20 billion business, however, is a matter of contention. companies specializing in shared office space have come before. as  the   wall street journal  noted this fall, the office-leasing company iwg manages five times the square footage but has about one-eighth the market value. even adam neumann, a co-founder of wework and its ceo, admits that his company is overvalued, if youre looking merely at desks leased or rents collected. no one is investing in a co-working company worth $20 billion. that doesnt exist, he told  forbes  in 2017. our valuation and size today are much more based on our energy and spirituality than it is on a multiple of revenue.  thats a striking statement. shuffleboard tables and free ipas, however enticing, surely cant justify the recent $4.4 billion round of venture capital propelling the companys growth. but these cramped quarters may hold more than meets the eye. weworks real value might indeed be in the elbow-to-elbow energy neumann describesjust not for the community you might imagine.  t he office sublet  is not an innovation of the digital age. but the idea of a co-working spacea collection of like-minded renters committed to forming a community is  a more recent development. its history might begin with the european hacker spaces of the 1990s, where independent programmers swapped coding skills in dark basements with an air of techno-anarchism. americans caught on a few years later. the first true co-working space, so-called, emerged in 2005, renting square footage from a feminist collective in san franciscos mission district. this eventually became the hat factory, an industrial loft in the dogpatch neighborhood, which described itself as a community office space for geeks and media hackers. it was co-founded by the guy who invented the hashtag.  the first wave of co-working served a relatively small, scrappy set of independent contractors and do-gooders. the second wave has responded to an economy in which independent work has become more default than choice. the 2008 financial crash forced employers to cut hours and jobs, and the emerging gig economy swelled the ranks of the self-employed. thus weworks eclectic mix of freelance writers, labor organizers, financial consultants, and app developers hustling for investors.  adam neumann was himself a struggling entrepreneur (he owned a company that sold baby clothes) in recession-era new york when he and a couple of friends rented out space in a brooklyn building to make some additional income. demand proved stronger than expected. in 2010, neumann, who was raised in part on a kibbutz in israel, and miguel mckelvey, who grew up with five mothers in an oregon collective and studied architecture in college, leased a few thousand square feet in soho and opened the first wework: a shared space where enterprising creatives could work and play.  from the start, wework offered a somewhat uneasy combination of its founders ambitions and co-workings communal roots. neumann describes wework as a capitalist kibbutz. members are encouraged to mingle, network, and leverage one anothers talents, frequently under the auspices of a corporate sponsor: witness taco pop-ups promoting internet phone service; talk-therapy circles sponsored by a womens activewear brand; cocktails served up by the payroll-software giant adp. billed as community-building programming, the events can feel more like exercises in targeted advertising, with members as the marks. genuine connections do occursometimes at happy hours and often through weworks online member network, where people share marketing tips, sell furniture, organize cryptocurrency seminars. (the variety of requests never ceases to amaze. quickly fulfilled: any wework salted cured meat companies? apparently unfulfilled: can anyone refer me to a good venture capitalist in the nyc area?)  despite the companys occasional excesses, wework offices  are  more pleasant than many a soulless cubicle farm, according to people i spoke with at locations in new york; washington, d.c.; boston; and los angeles. people are relaxed. no ones watching the clock, says liz granda, who works for brooklyn paws, a concierge service for pet owners, in a wework under the manhattan bridge. the relentlessly cheerful vibe encourages members to be social, or at least forces them to be nice. nicole shore, the principal of zero to sixty communications, a boutique pr firm, has rented desks in locations around the country. she told me she got to know her go-to graphic designer at a wework christmas party. at its best, with its abundant conveniences and event-directing community managers, wework can feel like an all-inclusive cruise.  cruises, of course, arent for everyone. many observers in the real-estate industry say wework is wildly overvalued, and its aggressive expansion plans unrealistic. although it has reportedly begun raising money for a real-estate-investment fund, the company owns few physical assets. its practice has been to sign long-term leases en masse, striking multiproperty agreements to get the best deals with landlords, then renting spaces at a premium. (many members told me that, per square foot, wework is considerably pricier than a traditional rental, but that theyre willing to pay extra for the turnkey flexibility and sense of community.) its a classic lease-arbitrage model, which business-school professors will tell you carries significant risk: whenever the next economic downturn hits, demand for office space may retreat, leaving wework with a lot of empty desks and multiyear leases to pay.  investors have seen this movie before. iwg, itself a network of flexible office spaces, expanded rapidly in the 1990s (it was known as regus at the time) on a wave of high-hope investment, only to seek bankruptcy protection after the dot-com bust. what distinguishes the younger player, really, besides charismatic leadership and lofty rhetoric? wework is nothing but regus with a paint job, one industry veteran told  the wall street   journal . many investors have placed their bets because theyre dazzled by neumann, konrad putzier, a real-estate reporter at  the real deal , told me.  w ework may be positioning itself  more strategically than some of its detractors allow. more and more of the people inside the glass-walled grids are not entrepreneurs or gig workers. theyre employees of facebook, amazon, general electric, ibm, bank of america, and hundreds of other large corporations. blue-chip companies are the fastest-growing segment of weworks client base. their employees now represent more than 25 percent of wework members.  at wework, companies with more than 1,000 employees globally are known as enterprise members. veresh sita, an executive who oversees products for this group, told me that many enterprise members first looked to wework for temporary overflow space or as an outpost in a new market. now wework is actively courting them. our concept is \u2018come for a month, stay for life,\u2009 sita said.  the benefit that big companies offer wework seems clear: salesforce, hsbc, and facebook are presumably more reliable subtenants than a fluctuating mix of long-shot start-ups and quixotic nonprofits. what do corporations get in the deal? wework estimates that enterprise members save 25 to 50 percent in operating expenses, compared with traditional office build-outs. but members told me its less the cost, and more the convenience and cool factor, that draws them in. big, buttoned-up companies arent always good at providing the kinds of perks and services many workers have come to expect. weve become a talent feeder for the rest of the company, says adam litalien, the vice president of global consumer markets innovation at liberty mutual insurance, which leases space at a boston wework. were able to show people we do things that are less obvious when you think about liberty and insurance products.  wework offers more than just a chiller vibe. in a 2016 trial run, microsoft gave 300 salespeople in three u.s. cities access to wework spaces as an alternative to their existing offices in those cities. after a few months, more than 80 percent of the workers reported that the access made them more productive throughout their day.  wework is selling enterprise members on the idea that it can make their workers more productive still. sita told me that wework plans to sprinkle offices with data-harvesting sensors and facial-recognition software as part of its powered by we suite of services. the program will allow wework to monitor how employees use its spaces: how they adjust their desks, where in the office they spend their time, and maybe even how engaged they are in meetings. these datawhich, according to wework, would never be used to track the movements of individual employeescould allow companies to lease exactly the right amount of space, and exactly the right  kind  of space, too. phil kirschner, the director of workplace strategy, describes a future in which someone could check into any wework in the world and sit at a desk that automatically adjusted to the right height.  until that creepy, if ergonomically correct, future comes to pass, the benefits that wework confers on enterprise members may come from a tried-and-true real-estate verity: its all about location. microsoft employees noted that weworks scatter plot of primo sites gave them more-convenient access to clients. other enterprise members have benefited from new neighbors within weworks walls. the accounting giant kpmg has a 50-desk space in a manhattan wework. leaders say one of the greatest advantages has been access to the entrepreneurial talent of wework members. david pessah, the director of kpmgs innovation labs, previously worked at a snapchat-esque start-up in the same wework. repeated run-ins and informal chats with his now-boss led to a job offer. im not sure if i would have applied to kpmg, or been interested in the same capacity, if not for the wework environment, pessah told me. it was an easy transition.  sita said wework will soon begin offering some enterprise members the ability to manipulate, to an extent, who works in a given location. he offered an example: say a large pharmaceutical brand wants to work with biomedical start-ups. wework would seek out congenial neighbors by tapping willing members or interested recruits. every start-up wants to be an enterprise, and every enterprise a start-up, sita said. we think we have a responsibility to curate some relationship between these two groups.  the upshot of such an arrangement is not just the stuff of weworks corporate talking points. prominent 20th-century urban theorists like jane jacobs and the economist robert lucas argued that dense packs of talented workers boost local economies and innovative thinking; recent data-backed research supports the theory. in a way, wework is taking the creative clustering already happening in cosmopolitan centers and concentrating it even further, in a few thousand square feet of class-a office space.    what does that mean for the average co-worker? wework will try to balance the mix of members by location, sita said. he stressed that start-ups can benefit from proximity to blue chips, whether through knowledge-sharing, contracting, or even acquisition. that makes sense, at least in some cases. but a future where co-working is made entirely of big fish and little fish content to swim in one transactional bowl is a future that seems to leave out a lot of other fish: the vegan-meal-kit makers, the community bail fund, and hey, the journalists. we, too, are working here. what would big business want with us? and what would  we  want with big business? the day may soon come when were forced to repair to our dark basementsbecause the economy cools off, or because wework has cooled on us.     this article appears in the march 2018 print edition with the headline building a better office.", "kwds": ["in", "march", "2017", "the", "new", "york", "city", "\u2013",

eneath the bland veneer  of supermarket automation lurks an ugly truth: theres a lot of shoplifting going on in the self-scanning checkout lane. but dont call it shoplifting. the guys in loss prevention prefer external shrinkage.  self-checkout theft has become so widespread that a whole lingo has sprung up to describe its tactics. ringing up a t-bone ($13.99/lb) with a code for a cheap ($0.49/lb) variety of produce is the banana trick. if a can of illy espresso leaves the conveyor belt without being scanned, thats called the pass around. the switcheroo is more labor-intensive: peel the sticker off something inexpensive and place it over the bar code of something pricey. just make sure both items are about the same weight, to avoid triggering that pesky unexpected item alert in the bagging area.    how common are self-scanning scams? if anonymous online questionnaires are any indication, very common. when voucher codes pro, a company that offers coupons to internet shoppers, surveyed 2,634 people, nearly 20 percent admitted to having stolen at the self-checkout in the past. more than half of those people said they gamed the system because detection by store security was unlikely. a 2015 study of self-checkouts with handheld scanners, conducted by criminologists at the university of leicester, also found evidence of widespread theft. after auditing 1 million self-checkout transactions over the course of a year, totaling $21 million in sales, they found that nearly $850,000 worth of goods left the store without being scanned and paid for.  the leicester researchers concluded that the ease of theft is likely inspiring people who might not otherwise steal to do so. rather than walk into a store intending to take something, a shopper might, at the end of a trip, decide that a discount is in order. as one retail employee told the researchers, people who traditionally dont intend to steal [might realize that]  when i buy 20, i can get five for free. the authors further proposed that retailers bore some blame for the problem. in their zeal to cut labor costs, the study said, supermarkets could be seen as having created a crime-generating environment that promotes profit above social responsibility.  whether out of social responsibility or frustration with shrinkage, some retailers, including albertsons, big y supermarket, pavilions, and vons, have scaled back or eliminated self-scanning, at least in some stores. but others continue to add it. worldwide, self-checkout terminals are expected to number 325,000 by next year, up from 191,000 in 2013. in some places, meanwhile, the likelihood of being punished for petty shoplifting is decreasing. even if a manager wants to press charges, many police departments cant be bothered with supermarket theft. in 2012, for example, the dallas police department enacted a new policy: officers would no longer routinely respond to shoplifting calls for boosts amounting to less than $50. in 2015, the threshold was raised yet again, to $100.    perhaps its not surprising that some people steal from machines more readily than from human cashiers. anyone who pays for more than half of their stuff in self checkout is a total moron, reads one of the more militant comments in a reddit discussion on the subject. there is no moral issue with stealing from a store that forces you to use self checkout, period. they are charging you to work at their store. barbara staib, the director of communications of the national association for shoplifting prevention, believes that self-checkouts tempt people who are already predisposed to shoplifting, by allowing them to rationalize their behavior. most shoplifters are in fact otherwise law-abiding citizens. they would chase behind you to return the $20 bill you dropped, because youre a person and you would miss that $20. a robot cashier, though, changes the equation: it gives the false impression of anonymity, staib says. this apparently empowers people to shoplift.  which isnt to say that all shoppers feel equally empowered. frank farley, a psychologist at temple university, says that many supermarket thieves have what he calls type-t (as in thrill) personalities: shopping can be quite boring because its such a routine, and this is a way to make the routine more interesting. these can be risk-taking, stimulation-seeking people. according to this theory, some type ts become  base  jumpers or mafia hit men, while others settle for swiping brie and organic tomatoes from safeway.     this article

recent letter  to listeners, minnesota public radios president, john mctaggart, depicted damning  allegations  of sexual harassment against garrison keillor, the recently ousted host of the popular show  a prairie home companion . if the full 12-page letter or even a detailed summary of the alleged incidents were to be made public, we believe that would clarify why mpr ended its business relationship with garrison, he wrote. the statement is likely geared toward shocked fans, some of whom  criticized  the station for severing ties with keillor over what he said was a  more complicated  version of events. mctaggarts letter may quell some of mprs critics, but it doesnt answer the bigger question many listeners have: how could keillor and so many other beloved public-media stars have gotten away with such inappropriate behavior for so long?  within the span of a few weeks, accusations against other high-ranking and well-known figures have surfaced in the public-broadcasting realm, leading to their dismissal or suspension from organizations including npr, wnyc, and wbur. there was  david sweeney  and  michael oreskes  and  charlie rose . and  john hockenberry ,  tom ashbrook ,  leonard lopate, and jonathan schwartz . theres something odd about how many of the allegations of sexual misconduct in the media industry have come out of public mediawith its reputation for thoughtfulness and civility. hollywood was one thing, with its legacy of casting couches, hypersexualization of women, and clear gender imbalancesbut gentle, egalitarian public radio?  the industrys swift and aggressive response has been notable. stations have been quick to cut ties with those accused of sexual harassment. that stands in contrast to the choices made by other organizations who have sometimes chosen  different and less severe  forms of censure, such as the reassignment of glenn thrush at  the new york times  or the  six-month sabbatical  taken by pixars john lasseter.  according to the corporation for public broadcasting (cpb), a nonprofit formed in 1967 to act as a steward for the federal governments investments in public broadcasting, the  purpose of public media  is to provide programs and services that inform, educate, enlighten, and enrich the public and help inform civil discourse essential to american society. and that mandate requires the development of content that involves creative risk and that addresses the needs of unserved and underserved audiences, especially children and minorities. this guiding premise tasks public media with upholding a higher moral standard than for-profit media, and many presume that by virtue of working there, its employees adhere to those standards too. thats part of what makes these allegations so difficult for audiences to stomach.  public media is donor-based, meaning these outlets must appeal for their audiences support. in recent years, individual giving has  increased  for local public-radio funding and broadcasts such as  pbs newshour . that may be part of whats driving dismissals in public broadcasting. a donor-supported model gives people a sense of ownership and investment that i think is different, pete vernon, a staff writer covering media for the  columbia journalism review , told me. when it comes to stations trying to manage the fallout of sexual harassment, they understand how bad the optics are on this, and they understand their listeners are now incensed about it. they also understand that, especially for smaller stations, their livelihood can depend on their ability to court donations.  public media is made up of a large constellation of local, independent radio and television stations, which receive federal funding to help them provide free programming and services to their local audience. these stations can differ vastly in size, audience, and resources. some choose to become member stations to national outfits such as public broadcasting service (pbs) or npr, which give them access to additional programming. but often smaller stations find themselves strapped for cash, which can inhibit the ability to build up human-resources departments, or train staff and leadership about how to create an inclusive and safe work environment. many of the outlets implicated in recent harassment allegations certainly dont qualify as small or under-resourced, but if stations arent effectively managing these problems when theyre still tiny, they can wind up with big problems as they grow.   at wnyc, for example, the  newsroom grew  to around 70 workers up from three, in the span of about 20 years, according to  the new york times . *  but even as the station drew in more revenue and grew its staff,  some current and former employees told   the new york times  that human resources simply didnt keep pace. now, after the firings of john hockenberry, who hosted  the takeway ; leonard lopate, who hosted  the leonard lopate show ; and jonathan schwartz, who hosted programs on american musical standards; laura walker, the president of new york public radio, has called for a review of hr policies related to harassment retaliation and discrimination. at a board meeting following the accusations of sexual harassment, walker said that she was profoundly pained and sorry that the wnyc workplace did not, at times, live up to the values our programming embodies.  while many people i spoke with say public medias harassment problem isnt worse than other segments of media, its clear that the systems in place to cope with issues of sexual harassment have been woefully inadequate. julie drizin, the executive director of  current , a nonprofit publication focused on public media, says that the lack of robust human-resources departments that would include training and specific reporting mechanisms in instances of harassment may be a part of the problem, at least at some stations. a lot of corporations invest a lot more in hr. i think thats one of the things that separates public media from other kinds of media, she says.  still, even with its well-known deficiencies, public media doesnt quite fit the stereotypes of a male-dominated, hostile work environment. vivian schiller, the former ceo of national public radio, told me that public broadcasting, particularly npr, has long been considered a space where women can thrive. when i was there, most of the leadership was women, schiller said. in fact, four women, cokie roberts, nina totenberg, linda wertheimer, and susan stamberg, are often referred to as the  founding mothers  of npr. and the organizations  most recent data  on newsroom makeup shows that more than half of newsroom employees are women. the fact that a culture of harassment and bullying were allowed to fester for for years, all while women sat in positions of  power  and control, makes the issue all the more confusing. but if you consider the  discord  on other issues, such as between public medias stated commitment to diversity and its predominantly white audiences and newsrooms, its clear that the overarching vision of public broadcasting often doesnt manifest in real and critical ways.  schiller told me that she was shocked by the wave of allegations, and even more so by the fact that so many at npr had remained quiet about them for so long. my experience with the npr newsroom is that they had absolutely no hesitation to speak out about things that they felt werent right, unfair, or that were bothering them, she said. she sees the recent upheaval in a positive lightan indication that public media is going to be a leader when it comes to coping with these issues. there is a seriousness of purpose to make things right, and to try to fix whatever systems were and werent in place that allowed this to happen, she said.  for now though, most stations i spoke with are still in the process of conducting investigations to determine just how far issues of discrimination go, and what systems have allowed them to flourish. as public broadcasting attempts to cope with its #metoo moment, leadership will have make sense of the dissonance of widespread sexual harassment in a space known for nurturing womens careers. they may find themselves facing other contradictions, as well such as persistent racial inequality in a space that has a mandate to be thoughtful about diversity. stations have an opportunity not only to contend with individual harassers or failing policies, but to also think broadly about how to create newsrooms that live up to the values public media purports to uphold.       *this article originally mischaracterized the size of wnycs newsroom. we regret the error.", "kwds": ["in", " ", "recent", "letter", " ", "to", "listeners", "minnesota", "public",

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "is_blog": false, "img_loc": "http:https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/01/GettyImages_186224726/6d534d649.jpg", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-01 08:00:00", "summary": "san bernardino, calif.this community was still reeling from the recession in 2012 when it got a piece of what seemed like good news. amazon, the global internet retailer, was opening a massive 950,000-square-foot distribution center, one of its first in california, and hiring more than 1,000 people here.this opportunity is a rare and wonderful thing, san bernardino mayor pat morris told a  local newspaper  at the time.  in the months and years that followed, amazon dramatically expanded its footprint in and around san bernardino, a city 60 miles east of los angeles. the company now employs more than 15,000 full-time workers in eight fulfillment centers  ( where goods are stored and then packed for shipment )  and one sortation center (where packages are organized by delivery area) in the inland empire, the desert region bordering los angeles that encompasses riverside and san bernardino counties. this expansion provided a lifeline to the struggling region, creating jobs and contributing tax revenue to an area sorely in need of both. in san bernardino, the unemployment rate that was as high as 15 percent in 2012 is now 5 percent.  yet in many ways, amazon has not been a rare and wonderful opportunity for san bernardino. workers say the warehouse jobs are grueling and high-stress, and that few people are able to stay in them long enough to reap the offered benefits, many of which dont become available until people have been with the company a year or more. some of the jobs amazon creates are seasonal or temporary, thrusting workers into a precarious situation in which they dont know how many hours theyll work a week or what their schedule will be. though the company does pay more than the minimum wage, and offers benefits like tuition reimbursement, health care, and stock options, the nature of the work obviates many of those benefits, workers say. its a step back from where we were, said pat morris, the former mayor, about the jobs that amazon offers. but its a lot better than where we would otherwise be, he said.  san bernardino is just one of the many communities across the country grappling with the same question: is any new job a good job? these places, often located in the outskirts of major cities, have lost retail and manufacturing jobs and, in many cases, are still  recovering from the recession  and desperate to attract economic activity. this often means battling each other to lure companies like amazon, which is rapidly expanding its distribution centers across the country. but as the experience of san bernardino shows, amazon can exacerbate the economic problems that city leaders had hoped it would solve. the share of people living in poverty in san bernardino was at 28.1 percent in 2016, the most recent year for which census data is available, compared to 23.4 in 2011, the year before amazon arrived. the median household income in 2016, at $38,456, is 4 percent lower than it was in 2011. this poverty near amazon facilities is not just an inland california phenomenonaccording to  a report by  the left-leaning group policy matters ohio, one in 10 amazon employees in ohio are on food stamps.    amazons san bernardino fulfillment center in 2013 (kevork djansezian / getty)   the arrival of amazon has been bittersweet for people like gabriel alvarado, 35. he started working at amazons san bernardino distribution center in 2013, making $12 an hour, hoping that the job would help him support his new wife and two stepdaughters. amazon proved a stressful place to work, with managers chewing out employees for not moving fast enough, he told me, which was tough to put up with for meager pay. (an amazon spokeswoman, nina lindsey, told me that, like most companies, amazon has performance expectations, but that it supports people not performing with dedicated coaches to help them improve.)  meanwhile, gabriel watched as his 39-year-old brother jose worked across the street, doing the same type of job at a warehouse for the grocery chain stater brothers. the 1,000 workers there are unionized and get full medical benefits, pensions, and retiree medical benefits. wages start at $26 an hour, but many workers make a lot more than that because stater brothers operates an incentive program in which people who grab ordersdoing similar tasks to workers at amazonare rewarded if they go faster than the average speed. jose alvarado is able to support a wife and four children on his stater brothers salary. when his son was diagnosed with a rare form of anemia, his insurance covered everything.  though gabriel was doing the same type of work at amazon, he had to shell out more money for health care, and made a lot less money. i saw my brother doing the same type of work, but moneywise, he had better credit, he could afford more, while i was barely getting by, gabriel told me. he has tried to get a job with stater brothers to no avail, and says there are few other local options but at amazon or at companies that work for amazon. in 2016, he used amazons tuition reimbursement to get his commercial driving license, attending school on the weekends while working during the week. but the best job he could find was working for a third-party contractor, driving a truck for amazon. its either amazon or nothing, he told me.  the lack of other opportunities for people like gabriel alvarado illuminates the problem these communities face when deciding to offer tax breaks and incentives to compete for amazon to build warehouses in their towns. if these places dont get a new amazon facility, they wont instead get companies like stater brothers that are willing to come in and pay double or triple the minimum wage for jobs that dont require a college education. for many places, the choice is not between amazon or another, better employer. the choice, instead, is amazon or nothing. theres this way in which amazons warehouses are perceived to be a good thing for a community, but thats only because the context in which they are being proposed and built is so devoid of better opportunities, said stacy mitchell, the co-director of the institute for local self-reliance, a nonprofit that advocates for sustainable community development. its an indicator of how badly our economy is doing in terms of providing meaningful and valuable opportunities for people.  morris, the former mayor of san bernardino, told me that in 2012, amazon seemed like a lifesaver. san bernardinos unemployment rate was at 15 percent, home values had fallen 57 percent since 2007, and the city, facing a $45 million budget shortfall, would file for bankruptcy in august of that year. at the point they came in, any job is a good job, he said. but the jobs the company is offering are indicative of how the economy has changed in san bernardino in the past few decades. to a certain extent, based on the history, its a step down for families, he said. the jobs that used to dominate san bernardino were unionized ones with good benefits, at the kaiser steel mill, the santa fe railroad maintenance yard, and the norton air force base. now, jobs like the ones amazon creates pay less and arent unionized, and require multiple members of a household to work, often more than one job.  as amazon continues to grow at a rapid clip, more communities are in the same position as san bernardinodesperate to attract new jobs, even ones that pale in comparison to past opportunities, in the absence of anything else. although efforts to recruit new distribution centers garner less national attention than the race to attract amazons hq2 its second corporate headquarters, where the company is expected to add as many as 50,000 jobswhen added up, these other facilities create a large number of jobs. amazon now has 342 facilities, including fulfillment centers, prime hubs, and sortation centers, in the united states, up from 18 in 2007, according to mwpvl international, a supply-chain and logistics consulting firm. amazon employed 180,000 people in the united states in 2016, and said  last year  that it planned to add more 100,000 full-time, full-benefit jobs by mid-2018.     the company is a microcosm of the growing logistics industry, which is booming as more and more people order goods online. the company is growing even in places where it already has a substantial presence: although it already has eight fulfillment centers near san bernardino, amazon  recently announced  it was adding two more facilities nearby, creating 2,000 more jobs.  a mazon allows visitors  to tour one of its warehouses in san bernardino, and i went late last year to try and understand how distribution centers work. the warehouse, called ont2 internally, is a vast complex, where clean concrete floors stretch out in all directions covering the distance of about 16 football fields. bright yellow posts divide the different sections of the building, where people unpack shipments, load shelves, unload shelves, and pack everything from puzzles to lightbulbs into amazons ubiquitous brown boxes. conveyor belts covering several miles whir throughout the facility, moving goods among floors.  for local residents, starting work in this facility or one like it can seem like a blessing. at around $12 an hour, 40 hours a week, full-time jobs pay higher than many others in the region, and the benefits are also better than many other jobs in the industry. but workers are required to be on their feet all day, and receive scant time for bathroom breaks or lunch. theyre pressured to meet certain production goals and are penalized by getting written upthe first step in getting firedfor not meeting them, they say. theyre also allowed very little time off, and written up if they go over a certain amount of time off, these workers say, even if they get sick. this is according to in-depth conversations ive had with 10 current and former amazon employees. these employees work in the san bernardino facility, as well as amazon distribution and sortation centers in moreno valley, california; jeffersonville, indiana; and kent, washington. amazon has been sued in the past by part-time, contract workers. all but one of the people i interviewed were full-time employees, not contract workers, and they didnt think working directly for amazon was so great, either. as one worker, john burgett, a current employee in indiana who has detailed his experiences on the blog  amazon emancipatory , told me, its very physically and emotionally grueling. theyre walking a fine line in the communityeverybody knows someone whos worked there, and no one says its a good place to work.     number of amazon facilities over time      mwpvl international    many people who start out at amazon warehouses begin as pickers. these are the people who walk through the vast aisles in the amazon warehouses where goods are stored, and, reading information from a handheld scanner, put items that have been ordered online into yellow bins, called totes. the scanner gives pickers an amount of time to pick an item based on where it is stored, and blue bars on the scanner count down the amount of time they have left to complete the task. slightly more desirable than picking is stowing. stowers take bins of items that have been shipped to amazon and store them on the shelves for the pickers to grab when ordered. other employees work as packers. they take items from yellow totes, scan them, grab a box and packing tape, the size of which is recommended by a computer, and pack individual customers orders, putting the finished boxes on a fast-moving conveyor belt.  the workers i talked to said that the problem with these jobs is not just that theyre physical or monotonouswhich they arebut, rather, that amazon puts an incredible amount of pressure on people to continue to work faster and faster. many of the employees mentioned the fear of being written up and losing their jobs, which will thrust them into other low-paid jobs with fewer benefits. if pickers dont grab an item in a certain amount of time, they get written up. if they take too long a bathroom break, they get written up. if theyre not walking as fast or performing as well as the majority of employees, they get written up. you constantly feel like, \u2018im not doing enough, i need to do a little more, and thats their business model, burgett said. the constant trying to chase your rate, trying to stay ahead of being written upit affects you psychologically. this pressure is not limited to warehouse workers; a 2015   new york times  story  detailed a corporate culture where white-collar workers were pushed psychologically as well.  another man, a former carpenter who works in the stow department in moreno valley who didnt want his name used because he still works for amazon, said that without warning, amazon changed the amount of time workers had to stow an item from six minutes to four minutes and 12 seconds. they make it like the hunger games, he said. thats what we actually call it. workers are competing against an average time, and so they are, in essence, competing against each other. those who cant keep up are written up and then fired, he said.  another moreno valley employee, who has been a picker at amazon for two-and-a-half years, says the company constantly sends messages to workers scanners telling them to work faster. theyll run competitions such as a power hour in which workers are encouraged to work as hard as they can for a prize. one recent prize was a cookie. another time, the winner of power hour would be entered into a raffle to win a gift card. i dont want a cookie or a gift card. ill take it, but id rather a living wage. or not being timed when youre sitting on the toilet, said the man, who lives with his father because he and his girlfriend cant afford their own place ,  and didnt want his name used because he hopes to get promoted at amazon.    an amazon worker stows goods in the san bernardino facility. (alana semuels / the atlantic)   one woman i talked to in moreno valley, who didnt want her name used because she is in the process of suing amazon, said that working at the company strained her heart and caused her psychological problems that shes still dealing with. she was written up for not working enough hours after she went to the emergency room because of her heart problem, she says. on the other hand, she says, she made enough money at amazon to buy her first new car. thats what makes people not want to quitthe pay, she said. people say, \u2018you can treat me any type of way, since this is the best money we can get out here in moreno valley.  i did talk to one amazon worker who started as a picker and made his way up to management. david koneck, now 34 years old, was one of the first workers hired by amazon when the san bernardino facility first opened. at the time, koneck, who graduated from high school but not from college, was running a company that administered diagnostic tests for high-school students. that job was unstable in the aftermath of recession-era budget cuts, so when amazon announced it was hiring, he applied right away, attracted by the benefits like health insurance and a program that allowed him and his wife to share paid leave when they had their first child. he started by working as a picker on the night shift, and within nine months was promoted. both were good jobs, he told mehe and his wife bought their first house, in hesperia, california, while he was an hourly associate. (public records show it cost $182,500.) the company gave him lots of opportunities to move up and receive training in different areas, he said. after two years with the company, he was promoted again, and moved into management. today, hes an operations manager. i wanted to come in here and achieve as much as i could, and nothing has stood in my way, he told me. its been nothing but positive support for me. hes now trying to help other hourly associates move up the amazon ladder.  amazon says that many employees have similar experience to koneck. at one kentucky facility, according to lindsey, the   amazon spokeswoman, there are more than 100 employees who have been with amazon for more than 15 years. but the workers i talked to say few employees make it more than a year. their theory was that amazon begins to cull employees when they are reaching the two-year mark, at which point their stock options would vest. (lindsey says it is strongly in amazons interest to retain employees to provide them with opportunities to develop, because the company is growing so quickly.) the former carpenter says employees call workers approaching the two-year mark the walking dead because they are working hard not to get fired, but many of them will be. very few tier one employees ever make it to two years of continuous service, burgett writes. anecdotally, he estimates that about 5 percent of new hires receive vested stock shares. there are only two options, gabriel alvarado told me. you get tiredtired of trying to make rate every week, tired of the write-upsor you get fired because you didnt make quota or run out of unpaid time off. associates receive 10 hours of paid time off when they begin, lindsey told me, which is essentially one day off. most associates work four 10-hour shifts a week and only accrue a small amount of paid time off every pay period, workers said, which means it can take months to get another day off.  when were thinking about amazon coming in and creating a huge number of jobs, whats the quality of jobs? we should also be really examining that, said beth gutelius, a researcher at the great cities institute at university of illinois at chicago who wrote her dissertation about the warehouse industry in the chicago suburbs. sometimes these more exurban areas are really desperate for jobs, and you cant deny that, but places do have to really think hard about it.  c urrent officials  in san bernardino maintain that amazons presence has been a positive one. the new mayor, r. carey davis, told me that the city has seen a number of benefits since amazon opened its first warehouse. the company has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to local schools and charities, for example. the city of san bernardino has found that amazon has been a very good neighbor and private partner for the city of san bernardino, he said. amazons presence has signaled to other cities that san bernardino is a good place to locate, with qualified workers, and an efficient city government, said mike burrows, the executive director of the inland valley development agency and the san bernardino international airport authority. its helped create jobs on the land once used by the norton air force base until it closed two decades ago. amazon recently surpassed stater brothers, which had been the largest employer on the land formerly occupied by the air force base with 2,000 employees, according to the inland valley development agency. now, amazon has 4,900 employees in san bernardino.  the arrival of amazon may have been good for other businesses in the inland empire, but its effects on individual residents seem less positive. while warehousing and storage was one of the fastest-growing sectors in the inland empire over the past decade, adding 35,800 jobs, the area also has the  lowest  annual private-sector average wage out of the countrys 50 largest metropolitan areas. a  report  from the institute for local self-reliance found that amazon paid 11 percent less than the average warehouse in the inland empire; a similar  analysis  by  the economist  found that workers earn about 10 percent less in areas where amazon operates than similar workers employed elsewhere.    kevork djansezian / getty   there is potential for amazon to be the shining knight that city officials hope it will be when it opens in their cities. amazon could become more like stater brotherspaying workers more, incentivizing efficiency rather than punishing workers who fall behind, supporting efforts to form a union. it could treat workers like jose alvarado is treated. after 11 years at stater brothers, alvarado, who also plays on the company softball team, has no plans to leave. im able to support my whole family and live a really good life, he told me, a stark contrast to his brother.  but that would require a wholesale change in amazons business practices, which would probably not sit well with consumers who have become accustomed to free shipping and cheap goods. (amazon is losing money on its e-commerce operations, which are subsidized by other parts of its business. )  more opportunity for folks with less education is generally a good thing, said gutelius, the chicago researcher. it would be a much better thing if the job quality were better, if there were some real kind of job ladder over time, she said.  efforts to get amazon to change its labor practices have been unsuccessful thus far. randy korgan, the business representative and director of the teamsters local 63, which represents the stater brothers employees, told me that his office frequently gets calls from amazon employees wanting to organize. but organizing is difficult because theres so much turnover at amazon facilities and because people fear losing their jobs if they speak up. burgett, the indiana amazon worker, repeatedly tried to organize his facility, he told me. the turnover was so high that it was difficult to get people to commit to a union campaign. the temps at amazon are too focused on getting a full-time job to join a union, he said, and the full-time employees dont stick around long enough to join. he worked with both the local seiu and then the teamsters to start an organizing drive, but could never get any traction. he told me that whenever amazon hears rumors of a union drive, the company calls a special all hands meeting to explain why a union wouldnt be good for the facility. (lindsey said that amazon has an open-door policy that encourages associates to bring concerns directly to the management team. we firmly believe this direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the needs of our workforce, she wrote, in an email.)  gabriel alvarado, too, said he talked with some friends about starting a union in san bernardino, after contrasting his situation with that of his brother. amazon soon called a meeting and asked workers what they wanted to make their jobs better, he says, but few of the workers suggestions were carried out. no amazon warehouse has been organized thus far. in 2014, workers at an amazon warehouse in middletown, delaware, voted 21\u20136 against joining the international association of machinists and aerospace workers. burgett thinks these outcomes are the result of, what he calls in his blog, amazons well-oiled and well-financed anti-union machinery.  t here are many   other reasons  communities might pause before welcoming an amazon warehouse. but many still welcome the company, believing that its better to have some jobs in the new amazon economy than no jobs at all. fresno, another economically depressed city in california,  offered  amazon $15.3 million in property tax rebates and $750,000 in sales tax rebates to locate a facility there, an offer amazon was happy to take up. amazon won $23 million in local tax incentives  over two years  to open distribution centers in three texas cities. the company has received $48 million in state, county, and city financial incentives to  build facilities  in florida.  this race to the bottom may be preventing cities from holding amazonor other logistics companiesaccountable. after all, most communities arent in a position to negotiate with amazon to ensure that workers will be treated well. last year, i interviewed michael tubbs, the mayor of stockton, california, shortly after amazon announced  in august  that it was locating a distribution center and 1,000 jobs in the inland city in northern california. tubbs is young and progressive, but still told me that stockton had little power over amazon. i dont think the city of stockton currently, with an unemployment rate double the state average, is in a position to make a ton of demands on companies who can go anywhere, he told me. san bernardino had tried to negotiate that it would get a portion of the sales tax of all the goods that came through its distribution center, but ultimately spent money to build roads and provide police and fire protection to the warehouse and does not get any sales tax revenues from the warehouse, morris said. (the state of california, not amazon, quashed the deal.)  as the race for amazons hq2 shows, other cities competing for amazon jobs offer up all sorts of concessions, and worry that in passing any wage and hour mandates, theyll lose the jobs. i think often, local policymakers are really eager to get companies in, they want employment, but they dont necessarily give a lot of stipulations about how many of these workers are temps, how many are paid a living wage, ellen reese, chair of the labor-studies program at the university of california, riverside, told me.  its true that cities desperate for jobs may find it difficult to attract companies if they pass minimum-wage mandates or other labor laws. but the alternative, it seems, is jobs that dont create a middle-class lifestyle for residents, which in turn affects local spending, the housing market, the tax base, and leads to a poor standard of living. many cities, san bernardino included, are calculating that any job creation is good news. they may soon find that with amazon, that calculation does not apply.", "kwds": ["san", "bernardino", "calif.this", "community", "was", "still", "reeling", "from", "the",

(the other one is the series finale of  m*a*s*h .)  but this superlative legacy is in tension with an equal and opposite force: the steady collapse in nfl viewership. the size of the leagues average per-game audience  has declined  by about 17 percent since 2015, an astonishing fall for the crown jewel of pay tv.  to explain the mystery of cascading football ratings, observers have pointed to several potential culprits. in the autumn of 2016, analysts  blamed  the election and donald trumps nonstop antics for pulling viewers attention from football to the presidential campaigns. last year, they  blamed  players protests and the presidents relentless tweeting. but now evidence is mounting that the nfls problems are deeper than political story lines and social-media distractions.  quite simply, televised football has a  television  problem and a  football  problem. the television problem is prominent yet simple. fewer people are subscribing to pay tv, which means that ratings are declining for just about everything on cable and broadcast. to pick an example quite different from football: the audience for last weekends grammys telecast  declined  by nearly 10 million, a stunning 30 percent drop in one year that is related to the fact that  cord-cutting is accelerating , leaving fewer people (especially young people) with access to cable tv. attention has shifted from pay tv to mobile devices, which aggregate football highlights, stats, and fantasy scores, allowing more fans to closely follow the sport without actually watching it live on television.  the football problem, though, is more complicated, in part because there are so many fan conjectures and politically motivated conspiracy theories competing for explanatory power. are viewers turning away from football because of concussions? players protests? donald trumps poisoning the league with political tweets? players  having too much fun ? players  not having enough fun ? there isnt much hard evidence to prove any of these hypotheses correct.  instead there is evidence, sometimes circumstantial and often crystal clear, that football has suffered as its most popular players and teams have disappointed, in various ways. nfl ratings peaked several years ago, when some of the greatest quarterbacks in history were in their record-setting primes and most of the leagues most popular teams were competitive.  thats simply not the case anymore. many of the most popular and marketable players in the nfl in 2017 are either injured (like aaron rodgers, andrew luck, and j.j. watt), playing for mediocre or noncompetitive teams (like russell wilson, von miller, and eli manning), or both (like odell beckham jr.). it ought to concern the league that the remainder is composed mostly of quarterbacks aged 35 and over (tom brady, drew brees, ben roethlisberger). of the  10 nfl players with the best-selling jerseys , only one made the playoffs without being injured or suspended: tom brady.  compare this sorry picture to the nba, where  14 of the 15 players  with the best-selling jerseys are healthy and active, and 13 are projected to make the playoffs. basketball telecasts on espn and tnt are attracting  15 percent more viewers  than last year, even though their average viewership is still just  one-tenth  the size of sunday night football. the upshot is straightforward: live sports are blockbuster events that fans attend (either in person or virtually) to watch superheroic performances. when those superheroes are playing, ratings stabilize or rise. when those same players are just wearing sweatpants on the sidelines, ratings drop.  but its not just a dearth of star players; the nfl also suffers when its most popular franchises are suffering. this has been particularly clear in the playoffs, which have shown some of the worst ratings declines of the year. an analysis by the media research firm moffettnathanson ranked the leagues teams by internet traffic to their official websites. just four of the 13 most popular teams made the playoffs. but of the 10 least popular teams in the league, half of them made the postseason and played in the first round of the playoffs. it will surprise no one that ratings for that week were dismal, down 20 percent from the previous year.     the most popular nfl teams, by traffic to their websites      moffettnathanson    the implication is straightforward: ratings dive when the most popular teams take a dive, too. as long as the dallas cowboys, green bay packers, or another popular team is playing and winning and throwing touchdown passes all over the place, football audiences are still astronomical and fairly bulletproof. (indeed,  the six most-watched playoff games  from last year all involved the no. 2 packers or no. 4 steelers.) but when kansas city plays tennessee in the first round of the playoffs,  ratings plummet . by this analysis, tom bradys  super bowl\u2013clinching comeback  against the unheralded jacksonville jaguars may have saved nbc and its advertisers tens of millions of dollars worth of captive attention.  and this is precisely why the decline and fall of the nfl is such a big deal for televisionand, truly, for much of the retail industry. television is a $70 billion advertising business, and the nfl is its keystone. the super bowl is by far the largest live broadcast event in the u.s. football accounts for almost half of foxs gross ratings points (a common proxy in the ad industry for audience reach) and at least one-eighth of the same measure for cbs, nbc, and espn. its demise will encourage more large media companies to mergeas  disney and fox  have proposed and  cbs  is allegedly discussingand nudge even more commercial dollars to internet advertising companies, where google and facebook stand to benefit. footballs rise to cultural dominance mirrored the ascent of pay tv as  the single best business model in american entertainment history . today, both industries are falling back to earth together.", "kwds": ["every", "year", "the", "story", "of", "the",

 the other set of numbers in the modelthe utilization rate of the self-driving trucksis the component that leads uber to a different analysis of the effect that these vehicles will have on truckers. basically, if the self-driving trucks are used far more efficiently, it would drive down the cost of freight, which would stimulate demand, leading to more business. and, if more freight is out on the roads, and humans are required to run it around local areas, then there will be a greater, not lesser, need for truck drivers.  if you believe the [automation] narrative thats out there today, it is especially counterintuitive, woodrow says, because the more self-driving trucks you have and the higher utilization they have, the more jobs it creates.    one of ubers scenarios of self-driving trucks stimulating growth in trucking jobs (uber)   this is not the story thats prevailed in the last couple of years. goldman sachs, for example, predicted trucker  job losses of 25,000 per month  as self-driving trucks roll out. mckinsey global institute put out a report with the  possibility of 1.5 million jobs lost  in trucking over the next 10 years. the international transport forum proposed that  2 million american and european truckers  could be directly displaced by 2030.  truckers, in fact, have become the go-to example for people who should be worried about robots taking their jobs. the technology for highway driving is very close to deployment, and therefore, these reports have assumed, the humans in the trucks will not be necessary soon.  but people within the trucking industry have always been  far more  skeptical about the potential for job displacement. they have argued that truckers dont just drive on highways. these jobs, in fact, require a wide variety of skills and the ability to operate in a host of unusual physical and social environments.  there are so many things a driver does, says joe rajkovacz, the director of governmental affairs and communications at the western states trucking association. i just dont believe that youre ever going to see, at least in the world thats imagined right now, this fully autonomous truck without anyone in it. for example, he pointed out that if a self-driving truck breaks down a hundred miles from nowhere, a company would have to send a tow truck out into the vast spaces of the american west, whereas an onboard driver or operator could make a variety of basic fixes and continue the trip.  ubers woodrow agrees that drivers do an astonishing variety of things beyond driving. in his first days on the job, after arriving at uber from alphabets x research wing, he took a ride from stockton to a cannery with a load of tomatoes, taking notes along the way about what the drivers he encountered were doing. the drivers are getting in and out of the truck. they are moving axles. they are checking brakes, checking air hoses. they are talking to people. building a self-driving truck is not just about finding a way to have the truck drive in a straight line on a highway, he says. there is so much to be done there before you get anywhere near being able to do the things that truck drivers are doing in an industrial facility or even on surface streets.  over time, rajkovacz has become a believer that the technology could make truckers lives better, not necessarily by changing where they drive, but how. in a perfect world, i could hop in the bunk in salt lake city, optimize my speed settings for fuel economy, literally set it at 55, and say, \u2018im taking my siesta, wake back up, and take over in reno, he says. i get that people think im smoking bird shit, but thats what we are ultimately talking about with this technology.    a test driver pulls the old look, no hands! inside an uber self-driving truck. (uber advanced technologies group)   making truckers lives better seems like it should be the major focus for trucking companies. the industry regularly promotes that there is a huge shortage of truck drivers. they dont tend to mention thats because the jobs are so hardphysically, emotionally, and economicallythat the industry is approaching 100 percent turnover per year, according to steve viscelli, a sociologist at the university of pennsylvania and author of  the big rig: trucking and the decline of the american dream . the labor case for self-driving trucks is really pretty good, viscelli says. you got this crappy job that no one really wants to do long-term.  people can be away from their families for 200 days a year. most young people are not willing to make that trade-off. so, right now, and in the foreseeable future as the trucking workforce continues to age, there are likely to be too  few  drivers, not too many.    uber foresees a transformation of the kind of trucking thats done by humans. (uber)   this might change in ubers scenarios. the deployment of transfer hubsor what viscelli has more evocatively called truck portswould mean that most working truckers stay fairly close to home. this would mean a major shift in the geographic structure of the work. right now, truckers can live in far-flung places where their wages go further. in a world filled with truck ports, the rising number of local trucking jobs would be more geographically concentrated around centers of production and consumption. northern california, yes. northern idaho, no. some of these long-haul truckers would find their wages dropping or lose their livelihoods as self-driving trucks drove down the cost of highway freight shipping.  that said, for most people, the truck port could be an improvement on the current situation.  the truck port idea is great for a lot of reasons: congestion, fuel economy, which brings in greens and transportation planners, even your average commuter is going to be thrilled to have 10,000 trucks out of l.a.s 4 oclock congestion, says viscelli. the big question is what those local jobs at the truck ports are going to look like.  right now, there is already a model of short-haul trucking in and out of (shipping) ports; its called drayage. and those jobs, from everything ive ever heard, are considered the worst in the business. local, for-hire driving has traditionally been lower paid and has some of the worst labor abuses, viscelli said. and the quintessential example of this is port driving.  drayage truckers are paid on a per-load basis and end up bearing the brunt of any congestion at the port or on highways. the workforce in many coastal ports is primarily made up of immigrants without a lot of other options. they scrape by in small companies or as so-called owner-operators making very little money and working 18-hour days.  what uber is doing could end up creating good local jobs, but for that to happen, we have to have a robust enough policy framework to ensure that workers arent mistreated, viscelli said. if you have labor that is poorly paid and treated, itll be used inefficiently.  doug bloch, the political director of the teamsters joint council 7, which represents 100,000 teamsters in the west, had an even darker vision for how the truck-port model could play out.  they are going to be creating more of a vicious circle. youll have independent contract drivers hauling stuff between the hubs and theyre just going to be more crappy jobs, bloch said. and what will end up happening is this further erosion in job quality and this erosion is going to exacerbate the problem of the truck-driver shortage and it could potentially undercut employers like ups, who have employees who make good wages and good benefits.  in an industry where workers are already disempowered by  a nasty labor model  that has held down wages and kept many truckers from receiving benefits, the introduction of new technology is not going to go well for workers, no matter how well-intentioned uber might be.  even bloch, though, thought the general vision embedded in the uber study of an increase in transfer hubs was likely. there are definitely going to be jobs created by the changes in the supply chain, bloch said, though he hastened to add, but im not sure i agree that were going to have a net job increase.    the impact that self-driving trucks would have on trucking jobs  seemed  obvious to people typing up reports on computers about the industry: of course, self-driving trucks would mean less truckers. but whats clear from the trucking-industry experts is that there is a lot about the job and the industry that has not been adequately captured in the studies that predict a job apocalypse. or as the western states trucking associations rajkovacz, who drove a truck for nearly 30 years, says, i got more time sitting on the shitter in a truck stop than these people have spent driving trucks.  in particular, the question has been approached as a technology issue, rather than a social or political one. this model makes sense only if you fundamentally refactor the way we do wages in trucking, says karen levy, a cornell university sociologist who studies trucking and technology. and uber cant do that itself.  but uber  is  a much more powerful entity than a bunch of disconnected, basically freelance truck drivers who couldnt even collectively bargain if they wanted to, thanks to the sherman antitrust act. uber might be able to push for changes in how truckers get paid,  especially  for waiting time at the end points for pickups and drop-offs, which is currently unpaid in most cases.  it sucks that maybe this company is the one we have to rely on to make these broad changes, but im kind of putting my eggs in this basket, levy says. the government cant and wont. the truckers dont have the political power. it comes at a convenient time for uber, too because they need to do some good stuff.  in the end, every expert i talked to for this story, from the teamsters to academia, believes that the broad strokes of ubers analysis have some merit and represent a potential positive path for autonomous trucking to play in the labor market.  i was prepared to read this proposal and say, \u2018ugh! youre the worst! levy says. but as long as uber makes pushes on the organizational and regulatory front as theyre making these technical pushes, there might be something here.", "kwds": ["the", "outlook", "for", "trucking", "jobs", "has", "been", "grim", "of", "late", "self", "driving",

(democrats are negotiating over the increase, and are pushing for more money for the opioid epidemic and disaster relief.)  the rhetoric has changed too, with republicans no longer talking about the deficit and the debt in the heated, worried way they once did. during the 2016 gop debates, the  fiscal situation  came up far less often than it did in 2012, and with far less urgency too. the senate budget committee held  no dedicated hearings  on the debt, the deficit, fiscal stability, or balanced budgets in 2017, unlike in many years past. and, as a great   f  ivethirtyeight  analysis  has found, mentions of the deficit during congressional proceedings peaked at more than 8,000 in 2011 and fell to just more than 1,500 by 2015. for their part, administration officials refer to it infrequently, and often with little sense of outrage or concern. the president is very much concerned about the rate of increase of the debt, steven mnuchin, the treasury secretary, said at a hearing of the senate banking committee this week. over time, we need to figure out where we can have government savings to deal with the deficit.  so what happened? how did the same republicans who balked at a stimulus to get the country out of a recession rubber-stamp a bigger stimulus to fuel the best economy since the 1990s? how are the same republicans who  helped to construct  an automatic mechanism to slash spending now lifting caps, spending more, and leaving entitlement programs untouched?  i asked both democratic and republican aides those questions, and got mostly shrugs. in some sense, president trump is just doing what presidents george w. bush and ronald reagan did before him, aided by republicans in congress. both swore to balance the budget or to bring down the debt. both signed legislation that increased deficits instead, primarily through tax cuts and increased military spending.  many democrats, for their part, now believe that republicans exploited their sincere concern over the long-term fiscal situation to score short-term political pointswith some democrats privately vowing not to worry about paying for things once they are back in power. republicans never really cared about the budget deficit. it was always a political tactic. with their own tax cut, they said, \u2018go ahead and finance it with massive deficit spending, jared bernstein, an obama economic adviser, told me. democrats struggled to ensure everything they did was paid for, while, bernstein argues, republican fiscal irresponsibility has enabled them to provide all kinds of goodies to their donor base.  but washingtons understanding of the economic situation has changed, too, as bernstein admits. it now seems clear that the degree of deficit panic whipped up in the post-crisis years overestimated the risk of a bond-market reaction, overstated the risk of the government crowding out private investment, and underestimated the capacity of the united states government to run deficits and build up debtsas well as overestimating how much voters ever really cared about the deficit. if you go around yelling about pressure on interest rates and public borrowing crowding out private, you dont have a lot to point to in terms of data, bernstein told me. you have virtually nothing in terms of data. thats not just here. thats in japan, other advanced economies as well.  the risk that the country would not be able to fight a future recession due to its heavy debt burden might have been overinterpreted, as well. its something the left has invented because they lost the tax war, doug holtz-eakin, the former director of the congressional budget office and a republican economic analyst, told me. the country has room to expand its budget deficits even now, he said. if we were in a position where additional tax cuts or spending would be beneficial in a rapid way to help a falling economy, markets would reward, not punish, you for that.  plus, broad segments of the public seem uninterested in punishing even archconservative politicians who increase the debt, despite the promises of the tea party. indeed, the many seem not to care much about the debt at all, now that washington has stopped talking about it. the share of americans who say that they  see the deficit  as a top priority has fallen to 48 percent today from 72 percent in 2013, according to a survey by the pew research center. corporate executives used to travel to washington to express their concern over the countrys fiscal future. but on the tax legislation, they mostly remained mum. voters, frankly, after these huge deficits, are saying, \u2018well, how much do deficits really matter? rick santorum, the former republican presidential candidate, told  the associated press  last september. were not greece yet, right?  of course, the countrys true budget hawks remain unmovedand continue to push for putting the country on a different fiscal path. high debt is a drag on the economy, and the more positive effects of the tax bill will eventually be overtaken by historic red ink. the president also did not address the ongoing need to address our nations largest entitlements, which need to be strengthened, maya macguineas, the president of the committee for a responsible federal budget, said in a statement after president trumps address. we sincerely hope president trump and congress lay out a plan soon to put it on a downward and sustainable path. an excellent first step would be to agree to stop making it worse.  but for now, nobody from either side of the aisle seems to want to listen. the thing i cant say for sure but i wonder about is what happens when we hit $1 trillion in annual deficits, holtz-eakin told me. when it happened back in 2010, people flipped out. given how washingtons shouts about the debt have fast become whispers, that seems unlikely.", "kwds": ["isis", "tax", "cuts", "public", "trust", "race", "immigration", "the", "empire", "state", "building",

"pub_datetime": "2018-01-30 13:07:52", "summary": "amazon, jpmorgan chase, and berkshire hathaway  announced  on tuesday that they intend to form a new company that manages health care for their hundreds of thousands of u.s. employees, the idea being that a unified, not-for-profit entity can reduce workers expenses.  the surprising trio of the nations largest online retailer, largest bank by assets, and most famous investor (warren buffett, the chief executive of berkshire) riding to the rescue of the beleaguered health system already  rocked  insurance stocks and  thrilled  health-care experts who have long dreamed of a technological solution to bend the curve of inexorably rising medical costs.  but its not altogether clear what this company will be, how much money each corporation will commit to it, or whether it is meant to eventually provide services for workers at other companies. its also not clear how the venture will financially benefit the three corporations.  the ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the american economy, buffett said memorably, in  a statement . our group does not come to this problem with answers. but we also do not accept it as inevitable. in other words, this is not the launch of a fleshed-out business venture so much as the public announcement of a corporate collaboration fixated on providing low-cost services and slashing the gordian knot of ever-rising health-care costs.  here is a brief accounting of knowns and unknowns about the new venture. the new companyoperating outside all three corporationswill  provide  health care. but it is not clear whether this will be a pure insurance company or whether it will pay for its own doctors and clinics. the enterprise is supposedly going to use  technology  to lower costs. it is not clear what technology would be employed, or what costs will be lowered, or by how much. the company will be free from profit-making incentives and constraints. what does it mean to be free of profit-making  incentives , as opposed to actual profits? its not clear.  while jpmorgan and berkshire hathaway are listed as partners in the endeavor, amazon would seem to be the galvanizing force behind the announcement. in the last year, the company has  explored several health-care businesses , by selling more medical supplies, expanding its inventory of drug products, and hiring an executive to build a possible pharmacy business. these moves have already  so spooked the pharmacy and insurance industries  that they  reportedly pushed  cvs to place a $69 billion bid for the insurance giant aetna.  across the economy, amazon has become a kind of deflationary death star, so well-known for its high-volume, low-profit model that stocks plummet in every sector it threatens to enter. indeed, within minutes of the announcement,  shares fell  for pharmacy managers and drugmakers. as of 10:30 a.m. tuesday, large insurance companies like anthem and unitedhealth group were trading down about 5 percent, while the largest hospital companies, like hca, ticked up 8 percent. this suggests that investors believe the new health-care company will compete most directly with insurance firms and pharmacies rather than with hospitals and larger clinics. even so, if the corporate trio really wants to bring down health-care costs, they might try to open a network of low-cost clinics throughout the country that compete with large hospitals for less-complicated care.  if health care is, as buffett describes, a hungry tapeworm, the parasite isnt growing as fast as it used to. the rate at which medical costs increase each year has, with some exceptions, generally declined since the 2000s. between 2010 and 2013, the average annual growth rate in health expenditures was scarcely higher than that of gdp. as the economy picked up in 2014 and 2015, medical-cost inflation  turned up again .     consumer price index for all urban consumers: medical care      fred    for amazon to take the lead in taming medical-cost inflation continues an interesting trend in tech, with visionaries like jeff bezos, bill gates, and elon musk taking on the traditional roles of government, whether by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on basic research, sending rockets to space, revolutionizing infrastructure, or building new health-care companies. it might seem a bit ironic that three for-profit corporations would seek to create a nonprofit institution to do what traditionally has been done by the ultimate nonprofit institutionthe u.s. federal government. then again, at a time when libertarian corporate interests  have taken over washington , the work of governance is being outsourced, fittingly, to corporations.", "kwds": ["amazon",

(the gender pay gap exists even at the very bottom of the labor marketthe men on the farm were making an average of $45, according to the lawsuit.) what she wasnt spending on food or rent she was sending back home. my family was really desperately in need of financial support and i was worried about them, she said. she felt it was hard to bring it up with other workers because the crew manager was always lurking, and when she did ask about it the others repeated the same refrain: he has papers and you dont, so theres nothing you can do. she threatened to quit; he threatened to kill her if she did, she says. i was really scared and felt like i couldnt leave, she said.  in recent months, stories of sexual harassment and assault have been flowing on a daily basis from the entertainment, media, and tech industries. but low-wage workers, who are disproportionately women of color, are extremely susceptible to harassment in the workplace, and their stories receive far less attention. according to  data compiled by the center for american progress  (cap) from the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc), more than one-quarter of sexual-harassment charges were filed in industries with large numbers of low-wage service-sector jobs. this is particularly stunning given that low-wage workers often have few other opportunities, and may not have much padding if they lose their jobs in response to filing a complaint. the analysis by cap found that almost three-quarters of the harassment cases include an allegation of retaliation.  in a  2012 human rights watch report , nearly all of the farmworkers interviewed said they had experienced sexual violence or harassment or knew someone who had. in 2010,  a study found  that of 150 mexican women working in the central valley in california, 80 percent had experienced sexual harassment. eighty percentthats a pandemic, noelle damico, from the national economic and social rights initiative, told me. after explosive allegations of sexual assault against the hollywood mogul harvey weinstein, alianza nacional de campesinas, an association of farmworker women,  submitted a signed letter of solidarity  with the women of hollywood: we wish that we could say were shocked to learn that this is such a pervasive problem in your industry. sadly, were not surprised because its a reality we know far too well.  the history of agriculture in the u.s. always been one of sexual violence, said m\u00f3nica ram\u00edrez, the president of alianza nacional de campesinas, who comes from a family of farmworkers. on farms, conditions are ripe for it.  this entire industry was founded on a system of slaves, who were brought over and who suffered more greatly than we do even today,  said nely rodriguez, a former farmworker who now is a senior staff member and leader of the coalition of immokalee workers (ciw). those roots remain generation after generation, she told me over the phone through a translator.  in the second half of the 19th century,  on the heels of the mexican\u2013american war  and the abolition of slavery, mexican immigrants grew as a share of the american agricultural workforce. tens of thousand of migrant workers traveled between the u.s. and mexico with few restrictions.  in 1942, the u.s. and mexico created the bracero program, which allowed for millions of mexican men to come across the border for short-term work, predominantly in agriculture. although the program has long been abolished, the modern guest-worker visas perpetuate the industrys reliance on inexpensive, plentiful foreign labor in agriculture. the h-2a visa, a temporary work visa issued for seasonal agricultural work, offers limited protection to workers, creating a power dynamic that sets the stage for labor exploitation and sexual harassment. recruitment is a major pressure point with this visa, which permits an employee to only work for a single employer. if a worker is unhappy and wants to quit, her only way out is to leave the country altogether. the h-2a program is very difficult program because the employer has control, damico said. when you put that much control in the hands of an employer the situation is ripe for exploitation, through it doesnt mean it happens all the time.  for agricultural workers who are totally undocumented, the situation is even worse. in 2010 the  southern poverty law center interviewed 150 immigrant women  who were undocumented or spent time as undocumented workers in agriculture and food-processing jobs; all of them said harassment was a problem, and the majority had experienced it. like perez, these workers often dont know their rights and work in isolation. they are in different parts of the country and dont even know where they are. particularly for a migrant relying on a crew leader or someone to literally drive them state to state, ramirez said. they are reliant on the job to meet their basic needs for food and shelter, and they dont speak english, and often dont speak spanish, but an indigenous language, such as mayan. they cant access information to be able to get help. we have this huge problem with the immigration system and individuals dont have a pathways. perpetrators use their migration status to victimize them.  for perez, relief came with a flyer for the coalition of immokalee workers, given to her by a woman in a store. she called a hotline and two women came to her home. in april 2014, perez and six of her co-workers at c&c farms filed a federal lawsuit against the farm, its owners, and tapia-ortiz, alleging violations of four federal statutes, including the trafficking victims protections act, as well as various state-law claims. all seven workers were named only as john and jane does in the initial complaint because they feared for their safety.  in 2015, the workers  settled with the farm and its owners but not tapia-ortizfor full payment of back wages plus an equal amount in damages (the total sum to be paid was not disclosed). the attorney who represented the farm and its owners declined to comment beyond confirming in an email that the matter was resolved fairly to the mutual satisfaction of the parties without any liability admitted by his clients. but although the farm and its owners did not admit liability, they agreed to change practices on the farm by hiring laborers directly instead of through contractors and implementing new policies in regard to sexual harassment, according to  a press release  issued by the law firm that represented the workers. the farm has since gone out of business.  tapia-ortiz, meanwhile, did not participate in the lawsuit. after being personally served with the complaint against him in april 2014, neither he nor any attorney representing him ever appeared in the case. in june 2016, the court awarded a default judgment against tapia-ortiza finding of liability based on his failure to appearto the five workers who alleged that tapia-ortiz recruited them to the farm job. in february 2017 those five workers were awarded $3.5 million in damages from tapia-ortiz. the claim has yet to be paid, according to susan french, the lawyer for the workers and the coalition of immokalee workers.  there are signs of change in the industry. organizations such as alianza nacional de campesinas and the coalition of immokalee workers have stepped in and pushed for important reforms and efforts within the industry. the coalition of immokalee workers has developed the fair food program to ensure major food suppliers purchased tomatoes from farms with good practices. it is a worker-developed partnership among farms, farmworkers, students, the faith community, and corporations. we took deep experiential knowledge of what the issues are and turned that into a code of conduct and then went on to create all the necessary mechanisms to really change that power dynamic, rodriguez, the former farmworker and leader of the coalition of immokalee workers, said.  fair food farms have a code of conduct and a series of mechanisms for workers to report sexual harassment and a monitoring system to make sure farms comply. the effort also leverages the power of large corporations to help individual farmworkers. there are 14 companies on board so far, including walmart, mcdonalds, subway, whole foods and trader joes. the system could be easily adapted to other industries, and ciw has already introduced it to dairy farms in vermont. it represents hope for workers in an industry where, for generations, theres been very little.", "kwds": ["marlyn", "perez", "had", "no", "choice", "but", "to", "take", "the", "job", "at", "c&c", "agricultural", "farms", "in", "clewiston", "florida", "she", "was",

lowered taxes, and financial incentives for the wealthythings that a wealthy capitalist should in theory love sean jay-z carter still doesnt think that president trump is doing that much good for the black community.  in an  interview  with the cnn *  host van jones on saturday, jones brought up reports that trump referred to a number of countries, including many in africa, as shithole countries and then asked if it was okay for trump to say terrible things but put money in our pockets. carter unequivocally said no, adding its not about money at the end of the day. money doesnt equate to happiness. it doesnt. thats missing the whole point.  trump took umbrage at the remarks,  tweeting , somebody please inform jay-z that because of my policies, black unemployment has just been reported to be at the lowest rate ever recorded! as  ive written before , trump touting the black unemployment rate ignores some crucial context about the economy: first, the black unemployment rate has been dropping for the past  eight years . trump has only been president for one of them. second, even at 6.8 percent, the black unemployment rate remains nearly twice as high as that of whites.  \ntrumps response to carter confirms precisely what the rapper was trying to say in the first placethat the president fundamentally misunderstands the  aims of the black capitalism  and the needs of the black community. jay-z, and many before him, have espoused capitalism and economic empowerment as a means to an end: racial equality. being rich is a secondary benefit to the power, stability, and peace of mind that money can provide in a country that has forced blacks into poverty and segregation.  the president seems to think that a record-low unemployment rate for black americans is a demonstration of how much hedonald trump himselfis improving the lives of black americans, despite the fact that theres no evidence that the decline is the result of his policies or leadership. but black americans still earn significantly less than their white counterparts, even with similar levels of education. their wealth is still around  13 times  less. they are more likely to live in poverty and in poor housing conditions. they are more likely to be imprisoned, seriously hampering their earning potential for the rest of their lives. those are all issues that trumps policies dont even begin to tackle. and thats to say nothing of persistent inequalities in other critical areas such as health care, mortality, and police violence.  trump has frequently been criticized for his misreading of black america. he has talked  constantly  and inaccurately about the plight of black people living in inner cities. he has  misrepresented  his level of support in the black community. his tweet referencing jay-z is just the latest in an  ongoing pattern  of publicly feuding with prominent black americans who dont support him. again and again, trump has displayed an inability to grasp the actual problems that black americans must contend with, and the fact that his policies do virtually nothing to address them.        * this article previously stated that van jones is a host on msnbc. he is a host on

"president trump told the worlds elite business leaders gathered in davos that america is open for business as he tried to balance that message with the america first policies that he has put in place over the past year.  the world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous america, trump told the audience at the world economic forum. there has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the united states.  trump, who campaigned for the presidency as a voice opposed to globalization and the global elites, is the first sitting american president to attend davos since bill clinton in 2000. he told the audience that as president he will always put america first, but added america first does not mean america alone. when the u.s grows, so does the world.  the remarks, which were closely watched by an audience alarmed by what many in the global elite see as a u.s. retreat from the global trading system the country created, is at odds with the policies the trump administration has enacted after the president took office in january 2017. trump pulled the u.s. out of the trans-pacific partnership, a pacific region free-trade zone that included the regions largest economies and was viewed as a counterweight to chinas growing influence in the region. trump hasnt hidden his disdain for the north american free-trade agreement and has been ambiguous about whether the u.s. will stay in the agreement that also includes canada and mexico. last week, he imposed tariffs on washing machines and solar panels made overseas, an action reminiscent of the trade wars of the 1980s. more such moves are expected.  the president says his actions are aimed solely at helping american workers; that the free-trade deals of the past hurt american workers more than it helped the u.s. economy; and that the tariffs were aimed at the advantage, in his view unfair, that countries like china and south korea enjoyed in their dealings with the u.s.  we will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to the trading system, trump said friday. only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the united states but for all nations.  that might be the case, but the presidents rhetoric on trade and his seeming support for bilateral agreementsover multilateral ones has alarmed other world leaders. davos, which has been a cheerleading club for globalization, has seen much indirect criticism of the u.s. from its allies. german chancellor angela merkel this week said unilateral solutions would ultimately promote isolation and protectionism and u.k. prime minister theresa may said globalization had delivered the greatest advances in prosperity we have ever known.  earlier this week, trump said he was open to the u.s. re-entering the tpp if it was fairer to the u.s. its something he has said about nafta, as well, which the u.s. is renegotiating with the pacts other signatories. its uncertain though whether the world will wait for the u.s. to re-engage with multilateral systems. canadian prime minister justin trudeau said this week that his country would join the tpp without the u.s.joining australia, japan, and other pacific rim nations.  but if the audience at davos is concerned by trumps position on free trade, it appeared positively giddy at the presidents overhaul of the tax system. introducing trump on friday, klaus schwab, the wefs founder, said the overhaul would stimulate economic growth in both the u.s. and the world. trump, citing the economic gains made during his year in officeto the economy, to the stock market, and the unemployment rate, welcomed the worlds investors.  america is the place to do business, he said. so come to america where you can

it seems that, every week, a new group of media employees votes to join a union. on tuesday, a majority of employees at  slate   voted  to join the writers guild of america, east. this came a few days after newsroom employees of the  los angeles times   voted  to join the newsguild\u2013communications workers of america. two weeks before that vox media  recognized  the writers guild of america, east, as the union representative of their editorial and video staff.  these efforts are the latest in a slew of successful campaigns to unionize educated workers, not the traditional targets for labor organizers. in the past three years, employees of vice media,  thinkprogress ,  huffpost ,  the   intercept ,  salon ,  thrillist , and the now-defunct  gawker  have all joined unions. graduate students at columbia, yale, tufts, and brandeis have also voted to join unions. adjunct professors at seattle university formed a union in 2016, and employees at the legal group lambda legal  voted  to form a union in december.  labor advocates are declaring the wins for white-collar workers a new front for organizing, and indeed, labor has been making some progress in expanding its reach among educated workers. the number of people employed in professional and technical occupations who are members of unions grew by almost 90,000 last year, according to numbers  released  last week by the bureau of labor statistics. the fields of law, arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media all saw substantial gains in the share of workers who are in unions, ticking up from around 4 percent in 2010 to around 7 in 2017.  but these gains for unions are in stark contrast to the many high-profile failed efforts to organize less-educated workers in other parts of the country, usually outside cities. in 2017, after years of organizing, the united auto workers  lost a bid  to form a union at a nissan plant in mississippi. they  failed  to organize a chinese-owned auto-glass plant in ohio in november. the uaw similarly  lost a bid  to organize a volkswagen plant in tennessee in 2014. on january 19, for example, the nlrb announced that media employees at the  los angeles times  and professional employees at a pennsylvania charter school each voted to join a union. that same day the nlrb announced that drivers at a bakery in new jersey, drivers at a freight company in new york, and drivers for the hy-vee grocery chain in iowa all voted against joining a union, according to  nlrb data .  and while labor groups trying to organize low-wage workers in industries like fast food and the on-demand economy have made some gains in recent years, they have not created formal unions, but rather established  informal arrangements  that help workers. the share of workers who were members of unions in production, transportation, and material-moving occupations fell to 13.6 percent, from 16.2 percent in 2010, according to bureau of labor statistics data. in service occupations, that share fell to 9.9 percent from 11 percent in 2010.  the contrast, between the growing numbers of educated workers joining unions and the shrinking pool of blue-collar workers doing so, is yet another dynamic of an increasingly bifurcated american economy. as jobs for educated workers continue to proliferate in this economy, educated workers feel secure, sure that theyll be able to find more work if they lose their jobs. in some cases, that security may mean they feel they can advocate for a union, or stand up to employer threats to shut the workplace down if a union forms. blue-collar workers, by contrast, are competing for a smaller and smaller share of jobs in the economy, and thus may feel less willing to commit to labor drives. of the nearly 12 million jobs created after the recession, more than 8 million went to those with a bachelors degree, according to the georgetown center on education and the workforce. blue-collar workers may want a union, but fear defines union election to a troubling degree, harley shaiken, a labor expert at the university of california, berkeley, told me. you have the same fear among white-collar workers, but they know they have other options. if they lose their job, theyll have something two days later. that could give them more confidence about turning towards a union.  this difference in who is joining unions could create further bifurcation in the economy, as workers who are already relatively stable become even more protected by unions, while workers who feel themselves in a tenuous position have fewer places to turn for problems like wage and hour violations, sexual-harassment claims, or unfair termination. union employees are also better positioned to negotiate wage increases than non-union employeesnon-union employees make 80 percent of what union employees do,  according to  the bureau of labor statistics.  lowell peterson, the executive director of the writers guild, east, who has organized both blue-collar and white-collar workers in his career, said that organizing skilled workers might be easier in todays economic climate. if youre a semiskilled or unskilled worker, your leverage is a little different, he told me. skilled employees are hard for employers to replace, and they know it, he said. while employers think theyll be able to hire another worker off the street to stock shelves for amazon or work on a car assembly line, they worry about being able to find enough skilled and educated workers to do the white-collar jobs theyre trying to fill. [managers in media] cant just say, i dont care who does this job, as long as someone does it, peterson said.  white-collar workers may also have an easier time doing the work to organize a union. many  gothamist  workers were young and didnt have children, so were able to go to meetings after work, scott heins, 29, who worked full-time as a photographer and reporter for  gothamist  for two years and was on the  gothamist  organizing committee, told me. blue-collar workers are often older, and have families to support. and, since white-collar employees dont work on the factory floor all day, they are less physically exhausted at the end of the day. additionally, the access to information technology that white-collar workers have can make it easier to communicate with other employees throughout the company.  of course, white-collar workers still risk losing their jobs if a union formsthats what seems to have happened to 115 employees of  dnainfo  and  gothamist , two websites owned by joe ricketts, a billionaire who founded td ameritrade, after 25 new york staff members  voted  to join the writers guild of america, east. but many of those employees have since found other jobs, and peterson told me that the people who lost their jobs didnt regret organizing. heins told me thats how he feels. if forced into the same situation, i would do the same thing again, he said. heins said he and others knew the risks when they organized, especially when ricketts, who is vocally anti-union, purchased  gothamist .  but heins also landed on his feet. he is now working as a freelance photographer in new york, and said that it was going pretty well, in part because of support from groups like the economic hardship reporting project, which established a $5,000  fund  to help laid-off reporters from  gothamist  and  dnainfo . i am very fortunate in that photography lends itself well to freelancing, he told me.  in contrast to heins ability to find work after losing his job, many blue-collar workers cant afford to risk such a change. they are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck, and tend to have less savings because their salaries are lower in the first place. people were really terrified that they were going to lose their job, robert hathorn, a pro-union worker at nissan in mississippi, told the  website  labor notes   in the aftermath of the uaws organizing loss in august.   part of the divergence between white- and blue-collar workers may also have to do with where union drives are taking place. many white-collar workers live in big cities like new york and los angeles, where workers are likely to be more liberal and supportive of unions than in other places, and where owners (with obvious  exceptions ) may be less likely to embark on anti-union campaigns because of public pressure. but increasingly, manufacturing and production jobs are located in the south, where anti-union attitudes are most persistent. boeing located its dreamliner aircraft assembly line in south carolina rather than washington state to reduce the leverage of the machinists union, analysts  told   the new york times . and the failure of the united auto workers to organize plants in mississippi and tennessee was closely related to anti-union attitudes there, as i found in  previous reporting , attitudes that are less prevalent in automakers home turf of michigan and ohio.   educated workers werent always as open to organizing campaigns. in the past, educated workers eschewed unions for two main reasons: they had negative opinions about unions, and they felt that they had enough of a voice in their jobs that they didnt need union representation. both of those factors have changed in the millennial generation, according to ruth milkman, a professor of sociology at the city university of new york graduate center. today, 45 percent of millennials think labor unions have a positive impact on the country, up from 32 percent in 2010, according to  the pew  research center. thats partly because millennials are much  more progressive  than previous generations.  the current climate for media jobs may also be motivating some of the media-unionization drives, she said. while college-educated millennials know that they can get all sorts of jobs in todays booming economy, they are disappointed with the quality of the jobs in the media sector. these are people who were led to expect that if they did their part, the world would be handed to them on a silver platter, she told me. and then they find that these are crummy jobs.  of course, thousands of blue-collar workers are also finding that the jobs available to them in todays economy are crummy as well. but for them, the alternative to a crummy jobnothingis even

is having a tobacco moment, not  just here , but around the world.  urbanization, falling poverty rates, and growing global trade  have changed  the diets and expanded the waistlines of the worlds poor, with processed food and sweetened drinks becoming household staples. even very low-income communities are seeing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease as a result. but many countries lack the tax revenue and medical infrastructure to treat such conditions, leading to a burgeoning global-health crisis. to tackle it, a new task force of well-known academics and advocates is encouraging developing nations to treat candy and soft drinks as many of them treat alcohol and cigarettesand to tax them.  the idea might seem counterproductive, or even cruel. cheap calories have contributed to  falling rates  of undernourishment and a reduced incidence of famine. taxes increase costs, with a burden that falls most heavily on the most poor. and the relationship between added sugar and worse health is not a  clear-as-day causal one . but promoting empty calories might be crueler, experts argue. people say these taxes are regressive, lawrence summers, a leader of the task force and a former treasury secretary, told me. but i say premature death is regressive.  summers is co-chairing the new coalition along with michael bloomberg, the former mayor of new york city and the current world health organization ambassador for noncommunicable diseases, an honorary position. joining summers and bloomberg are, among others, tabar\u00e9 v\u00e1zquez, the president of uruguay, margaret chan, the former director-general of the world health organization (who), and nicola sturgeon, the first minister of scotland. the group of politicians, health experts, and economists plans to study fiscal measures that can improve public health and to urge lower-income countries to adopt them.  its creation comes as international organizations and individual governments are increasingly worried about the prevalence and cost of lifestyle diseases. the rate of  obesity has tripled in lower-income countries  that have adopted western diets and lifestyles, with doctors warning that the threat of diabetes has become pandemic. there are immense costs in terms of human suffering. and there are immense costs in terms of lost productivity, lost wages, increased health expenditures, and a smaller labor force. five main noncommunicable medical conditionscardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and mental-health conditionsare  estimated to cost  china $27.8 trillion between 2012 and 2030, and india $6.2 trillion. the price tags will be in the millions and billions for many poorer countries as well.  theres a set of lower-income countries, like bangladesh and ethiopia and myanmar, that will go in the span of 40 years from basically having no burden of noncommunicable diseases to having a similar burden as the united states or the united kingdom. thats three or four times as fast as high-income countries had to make that epidemiological transition, said thomas bollyky, a global health expert at the council on foreign relations, the new york\u2013based think tank. if you cant slow this down and give countries time to adapt, theyre dealing with a problem coming four times as fast with a quarter of the resources.  some noncommunicable conditions might best be targeted with low-cost medical interventions: vaccines for hpv and hepatitis, inexpensive medicines for people with hypertension. for others, taxes might be part of the answer. for the first time in the history of the world, more people are having their health affected by eating too much, rather that too little. thats a sea change for humanity, summers said, adding, its going to be a while before the developing world is able to afford open-heart surgery on a massive scale. fiscal measures are super-efficacious, both because prices matter particularly for younger and poorer people and because taxes are educative.  taxes do have a clear record of curbing the consumption of, and thus the public-health impact of, tobacco and alcohol. the who estimates that  raising excise taxes  on cigarettes by $1 per pack would push up the cost of cigarettes by an average of 63 percent in low-income countries. after such an increase, projections indicate, the prevalence of daily cigarette smoking among adults would fall from 14.1 percent to 12.9 percent, leading to 15 million fewer smoking-attributable deaths. the group argues that tobacco-tax increases are the single most effective policy to reduce tobacco use.  studies are similarly clear about the effect of alcohol taxes, if fewer countries have them as an explicit public-health policy. nearly all studies, including those with different study designs, found that there was an inverse relationship between the tax or price of alcohol and indices of excessive drinking or alcohol-related health outcomes, one survey published in the  american journal of preventive medicine   found . making alcohol more expensive does not just cut down on rates of cirrhosis and cancer, researchers  have learned , but also reduces the incidence of car crashes, suicides, domestic violence, workplace accidents, house fires, and so on. at the same time as these kinds of vice taxes reduce the consumption of dangerous products, they boost government coffersproviding a potential revenue stream for health spending.  then there is sugar. sugar is where tobacco was in 1972, summers told me. the equivalent of the surgeon generals report has been written, but there has not been much that has happened yet to reduce demand. he was gesturing to a growing body of studies showing that taxing sugar leads to reduced consumptionwith a potential knock-on effect on obesity rates and health expenditures. perhaps the best evidence comes from mexico, which instituted a one-peso tax on every liter of sugar-sweetened beverages back in 2014,  leading to  a 5.5 percent drop in consumption in the first year and 9.7 percent in the second year.   these taxes help, and the people who consume the most are most affected, said barry popkin, an economist and nutrition expert at the university of north carolina, who studied the effect of the sugar tax in mexico. he said that while the burden of the tax might have hit lower-income people the hardest, the benefits might help them the most, too. the poor do pay more, but theyre the ones who cant afford health care. theyre not being treated much at all in terms of chronic diseasediabetes is not something you can treat cheaply. he added that the study did not show that mexicans facing higher prices for soda and sports drinks seemed to shift their calories into other kinds of junk food.  still, not all research shows such promising resultsnor is it clear that sugar taxes will lead to less consumption, and thus to lower rates of obesity, and thus to a lower incidence of noncommunicable disease, and thus to reduced long-term public-health spending, in part because such tax initiatives have not been around long enough to know. studies looking at the effect of actual soda taxes implemented at the state level find that, while the taxes do lead to a moderate decrease in soda consumption, the net effect on obesity is next to zero, reads one review of  the literature  in the united states.  moreover, critics have questioned whether such policies are fairpumping up prices for the poor with a questionable benefit for public health. others oppose them on the grounds that they are paternalistic and interfere with free markets. individuals decisions about what risks they are willing to take and how much they are willing to trade pleasure for diminished health are incredibly personal and should not be overly politicized, argues peter van dorn of the cato institute, the libertarian  think tank . plus, junk-food and soda taxes are often unpopular, raising the ire of grocery stores and food producers, along with citizens themselves.  in spite of all that, many countries have moved in recent years to use taxes to try to improve their citizens diets and cut down on health costs. thailand  recently instituted  a tax on sugary beverages, with hungary putting one on  junk food  and vanuatu putting in place significant  import restrictions . that should provide more data on the efficacy of such measures, and the best way to design them.  if they work, the impact on public health could be considerable, in terms of lower costs and higher revenue. youre also seeing massive demographic changes in these countries, bollyky said. it isnt that people in developing countries have grown fat and lazy and intemperate in their habits, and now they have these health conditions. its because of fairly dramatic shifts in their populations as well as in lifestyles, and their health systems need time to accommodate them. theyre having to do it faster than we did and with fewer resources.  the united states might stand to implement more vice taxes too, summers added. this is some of the lowest-hanging fruit for potential policy improvement.", "kwds": ["sugar", "is", "having", "tobacco", "moment", "not", " ", "just", "here", "but", "around", "the", "world", " ", "urbanization",

the day in late november when he showed up at the consumer financial protection bureau,  doughnuts in hand , mick mulvaney has  said  that things were going to change. for almost two months, the acting director appointed by trump has implemented  seemingly small, but important , shifts that indicate what the bureau will look like in the years ahead. in a  memo  to bureau staff made public by  propublica , mulvaney finally laid out his vision for the agency: a government entity that doesnt push the envelope.  in an email to the bureaus staff, mulvaney said that he had been struggling to come up with a central thesis for how exactly the agency would change. mulvaney wrote that the philosophy of the previous director, richard cordray, was to aggressively \u2018push the envelope in pursuit of the \u2018mission; that we were the \u2018good guys and the \u2018new sheriff in town, out to fight the \u2018bad guys. the acting director then declared, that is what is going to be different.  mulvaney went on to say the entire governing philosophy of pushing the envelope frightens me a little  its not appropriate for any government entity to \u2018push the envelope. the acting director described concerns that the bureau would overstep and create long-lasting damage to individuals, reputations, and businesses. what will this new philosophy look like in practice? mulvaney vowed to only pursue lawsuits if evidence of quantifiable and unavoidable harm is found. and the agency will rely more heavily on its rulemaking efforts as the engine of change, instead of enforcement, meaning that the bureau wont focus on fines or lawsuits to cull bad behavior. instead, the cfpb will primarily look to the creation and implementation of new rules, in hopes of changing dangerous practicesa process that is less punitive and more time-consuming.  this memo is in line with the plan that mulvaney has already started enacting. in the nearly two months that mulvaney has been at the helm of the bureau, he has  instituted policies  that have pulled back on the agencys rulemaking, enforcement, and collection of personal data. according to nick bourke, the director of the consumer-finance project at the pew charitable trusts, this strikes at some of the key areas of success for the bureau. enforcement has been the biggest impact the cfpb has had so far, bourke told me during an interview in november. and thus far, the implementations of new rules for prepaid cards, payday lenders, and mandatory arbitration clausesall considered big victories for the bureauhave been slowed or killed since mulvaney took on leadership of the bureau.  the process of paring back the scope of the bureaus enforcement efforts is already underway, and already questions have been raised about mulvaneys close relationships with some of the entities that he is now in charge of regulating. on monday, mulvaney shuttered an  investigation of world acceptance corporation , a small-dollar loan operation from his home state of south carolina that contributed an  estimated $4,500  to his political campaigns over a three-year period. earlier this month, mulvaney  dropped a lawsuit  against a group of payday lenders in kansas accused of misleading customers and charging interest as high as 950 percent. campaign  donation records  show between 2012 and 2016, mulvaney received contributions totaling more than $60,000 from groups in the payday-lending industry.  this new trajectory of the agency will almost certainly ruffle longtime advocates of the bureau and supporters of its work under cordray. many have feared that mulvaney, who has been a  vocal critic  of the cfpb, would shut down the agency, or, short of that, gut it from the inside. tuesdays memo didnt exactly assuage those concerns. when i arrived at the cfpb, i told folks that despite what they might have heard, i had no intention of shutting down the bureau, mulvaney writes. indeed, the law doesnt allow that.  in january, the acting director asked the federal reserve to refrain from giving the agency  any money  for the second quarter of 2018, saying that instead, the bureau could use some of the $177 million reserve fund accrued during cordrays tenure to operate. the requestor lack thereofwill serve to reduce the federal deficit by the amount that the bureau might have requested under different leadership, mulvaney wrote.  with a new mission for the bureau articulated, mulvaney has cemented the trump administrations vision of the cfpb: a smaller, quieter, and less active financial regulatorone that looks a lot more like the regulators of the pre-recession era.", "kwds": ["since", "the", "day", "in", "late", "november", "when", "he", "showed", "up", "at", "the",

{"feed_name": "The Atlantic - Business", "is_blog": false, "img_loc": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/avoAUWcwcrs", "pub_datetime": "2018-01-24 14:38:53", "summary": "toys r us announced on wednesday that it will close  about 180 stores  in the u.s., or about one-fifth of its domestic locations, as the company emerges from bankruptcy proceedings to restructure $5 billion in debt.  on one level, this is just the latest chapter in the never-ending saga of brick-and-mortar calamity as the retail industry focuses more on online sales. the first half of 2017 was among the  worst periods for retail stores on record , and the pain isnt nearly over. in the last four months, sears and kmart have  announced  63 imminent store closings (after shuttering 350 locations in 2017), gap  announced  plans to close 200 locations in the next three years, and walmart  announced  that it would close 63 sams club stores and lay off thousands of workers.  but while toys r us has suffered from some predictable brick-and-mortar burdens, its story is a complicated one that touches on family economics, modern leisure, and private-equity mismanagement. there are the three main culprits of the sad demise of americas erstwhile titan of toys.   1. its the e-retailers.   this story beginsas all modern retail stories mustwith amazon. the everything store sells toys nowbillions of dollars of toys, in fact. between 2015 and 2017, amazon toy sales grew 24 percent, to $4 billion. toys r us, whose revenue  declined  in those years by a similar sum, simply doesnt have the same facility with digital shoppers. last june,  the companys ceo  criticized the stores own website, including its  kludgy baby-gift registry tool , acknowledging that the store had simply fallen behind contemporary shopping habits.  failing to build an online presence is bad for any retailer, but its particularly deleterious for one whose core demographic includes parents short on time and cash. as my colleague rebecca rosen  wrote  last year, most households  dont have a stay-at-home parent anymore , which makes shopping excursions a luxury many families cannot afford. so more moms and dads are skipping the car trips and buying toys from a website they can trust.   2. its the debt, too.   its a mistake to consider toys r us nothing more than sears, but for kids. yes, the store was clearly hurt by the rise of amazon and other large retailers; walmart actually overtook it as the nations largest toy retailer all the way back in 1998.  but its collapse has been especially acute, due to terrible mismanagement by private-equity firms. after toys r us was taken private by kkr, bain, and vornado in 2005, it took on a lot of debt, leaving the company with repayments that have crippled it in a period of declining sales. toys r us has spent  more than $250 million  annually to pay back $5 billion in long-term debt. these repayments became unsustainable once revenue started to decline consistently, as it has each year since 2012. that left one option: for the company to declare bankruptcy and renegotiate the terms of its debt.   3. blame the kids and their screens.   it would be satisfying to exclusively blame private-equity sharks and retail conglomerates for the fall of toys r us. but theres another group that deserves consideration as a culprit: kids.  todays teenagers and children have been shaped by smartphones, social-media apps, and living-room bingeing, as the psychologist jean twenge  wrote  in  the atlantic  last year. this has coincided with a sharp rise in teen depression and suicide. less gravely, its also depleted the marketplace for hardware toys. in the last year, lego, mattel, and hasbro  have all reported  declining sales for key brands (like american girl or   star wars  merchandise ). maybe tactile trinkets have simply lost their luster among kids.  or maybe kids dont even know which toys are out there. last year,  the wall street journal   reported  that with millennials watching far less cable television than they used to, young parents and their children simply arent seeing the commercials that toy makers rely on to market new products. as a result, much of toys r uss merchandise is doubly cursedkids cant play with it on their screens, and parents wont find out about it on their screens.  while bankruptcy might seem like corporate death, the truth is that toys r us is far from defunct. with  $11.5 billion in 2017 sales , its toy business is still more than twice as big as amazons. but in the last decade, it has faced a brutal set of economic and technological forces that has left it heavy in debt and light in new customers. along with every other struggling brick-and-mortar company today, the scariest question is this: if toys r us cant cut it with 4 percent unemployment nine years into a recovery, what happens when the recession comes?", "kwds": ["toys", "us", "announced", "on", "wednesday", "that", "it",

federal reserve bank of new yorks center for microeconomic data today issued its  quarterly report on household debt and credit ,which reported that  total household debt increased by $193 billion (1.5%) to $13.15 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2017 . this report marks the  fifth consecutive year of positive annual household debt growth . there were increases in mortgage, student, auto, and credit card debt (increasing by 1.6%, 1.5%, 0.7% and 3.2% respectively) and another modest decline in home equity line of credit (heloc) balances (decreasing by 0.9%). the report is based on data from the new york feds consumer credit panel, a nationally representative sample of individual- and household-level debt and credit records drawn from anonymized equifax credit data.  mortgages are the largest form of household debt and their increase of $139 billion was the most substantial increase seen in several quarters. unlike overall debt balances, which last year surpassed their previous peak reached in the third quarter of 2008, mortgage balances remain 4.4% below it. the new york fed issued an accompanying blog post to examine the regional differences in mortgage debt growth since the previous peak.   bankruptcy notations decreased for the second consecutive quarter.   foreclosure notations remained essentially unchanged at the lowest levels observed in the new york feds data .   emphasis added         click on graph for larger image.     here are two graphs from the report:  the first graph shows aggregate consumer debt increased in q4. household debt previouslypeaked in 2008, and bottomed in q2 2013.  from the ny fed:  mortgage balances, the largest component of household debt, increased substantially during the fourth quarter. mortgage balances shown on consumer credit reports on december 31 stood at $8.88 trillion, an increase of $139 billion from the third quarter of 2017. balances on home equity lines of credit (heloc) declined again, by $4 billion and now stand at $444 billion. non-housing balances, which have been increasing steadily for nearly 6 years overall, saw a $58 billion increase in the fourth quarter. auto loans grew by $8 billion and credit card balances increased by $26 billion, while student loans saw a $21 billion increase.      the second graph shows the percent of debt in delinquency. there is still a larger than normal percent of debt 90+ days delinquent (yellow, orange and red).  the overall delinquency rate decreased in q4. from the ny fed:    aggregate delinquency rates improved in the fourth quarter of 2017. as of december 31, 4.7% of outstanding debt was in some stage of delinquency. of the $619 billion of debt that is delinquent, $406 billion is seriously delinquent (at least 90 days late or severely derogatory).  the flow into 90+ days delinquency for credit card balances has been increasing notably from the last year  and the flow into 90+ days delinquency for auto loan balances has been slowly increasing since

(maybe he meant q4 over q4, but that was only 2.5% - not exactly blown \"out of the water\".  this give me an excuse to update my graphs from my post three years ago.  overall, we should have been expecting slower growth this decade due to demographics - even without the housing bubble-bust and financial crisis.  one simple way to look at the change in gdp is as the change in the labor force, times the change in productivity.  if the labor force is growing quickly, gdp will be higher with the same gains in productivity.  and the opposite is true.  so here is a graph of the year-over-year change in the labor force since 1950 (data from the bls).        click on graph for larger image     the data is noisy - because of changes in population controls and the business cycle - but the pattern is clear as indicated by the dashed red trend line.  the labor force has been growing slowly after declining for some time.  we could also look at just the prime working age population - ive pointed out before the that prime working age population has started growing again.  now here is a look at gdp for the same period.     the gdp data (year-over-year quarterly) is also noisy, and the dashed blue line shows the trend.   gdp was high in the early 50s - and early-to-mid 60s because of government spending (korean and vietnam wars). as in example, in 1951, national defense added added 6.5 percentage points to gdp. of course we dont want another war   now lets put the two graphs together.     it isnt a surprise.  other than the early period with a boost from military government spending, the growth in gdp has been tracking the growth in the labor force pretty well. the difference in growth between the dashed blue and red lines is due to gains in productivity.  the good news is that the working age population will be growing faster going forward. the bad news is the political hacks will continue to ignore demographics.  however, due to demographics, 2% gdp growth is the new 4%.

(see chart below). this yoy increase was the highest on record though data are only available back to 2006.  on a monthly basis the ahe of supervisory employees jumped by 0.8% (seasonally adjusted) in january and 0.5% in december, resulting in annualized growth over this two month period of 8.0%.        click on graph for larger image.     prior to 2010 the bls only reported average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers in its monthly release.  since then it has become apparent that the ahes of supervisory workers are much more volatile than the ahes of production/non-supervisory employees (the standard deviation of monthly % changes in the former is more than twice as high as the latter).  moreover, outsized (significantly above trend) gains in the ahes of supervisory workers have tended to be followed by below-trend increases over the subsequent two months.  if history is any guide, that will be the case in the next two monthly reports.  supervisory workers accounted for about 17.6% of total non-farm payroll workers in january, so if the ahe of supervisory workers were unchanged from january to march (which would imply annualized growth of 3.9% over the four-month period ending in march), and the ahe of production/non-supervisory workers increased at an annualized pace of 2.5% over the next two months (slightly above the recent trend), then the yoy increase in the ahe for all non-farm payroll employees would decline to 2.7% in march from the scary 2.9% in january.

"ieee internet computing  just celebrated  its 20th anniversary.   on its 20th anniversary, the editorial board created its first ever the test of time award.  im honored to say they gave it to our 2003 article, \" amazon.com recommendations: item-to-item collaborative filtering \", which continues to be accessed, cited, and used in industry and research many years after its original publication.   in addition, for the  20th anniversary issue  of ieee internet computing, we wrote a new article,  two decades of recommender systems at amazon.com \". some excerpts:   for two decades now, amazon.com has been building a store for every customer. each person who comes to amazon.com sees it differently  its as if you walked into a store and the shelves started rearranging themselves, with what you might want moving to the front, and what youre unlikely to be interested in shuffling further away.   amazon.com launched item-based collaborative filtering in 1998, enabling recommendations at a previously unseen scale for millions of customers and a catalog of millions of items. since we wrote about the algorithm in ieee internet computing in 2003, it has seen widespread use across the web, including youtube, netflix, and many others.   the algorithms success has been from its simplicity, scalability, and often surprising and useful recommendations, as well as desirable properties such as updating immediately based on new information about a customer and being able to explain why it recommended something in a way thats easily understandable.   what was described in our 2003 ieee internet computing article has faced many challenges and seen much development over the years  we describe some of the updates, improvements, and adaptations for item-based collaborative filtering, and offer our view on what the future holds for collaborative filtering, recommender systems, and personalization.   .   what does the future hold for recommendations?  discovery should be like talking with a friend who knows you, knows what you like, works with you at every step, and anticipates your needs.   recommendations and personalization live in the sea of data we all create as we move through the world, including what we find, what we discover, and what we love  intelligent computer algorithms leveraging collective human intelligence  computers helping people help other people.   the field remains wide open. an experience for every customer  offering surprise and delight  is a vision none have fully realized. much opportunity remains to add intelligence and personalization to every part of every system, creating experiences that seem like a friend that knows you, what you like, and what others like, and understands what options are out

( [1] )    new google ai incubator: \"investment arm aimed squarely on artificial intelligence  will operate almost like an incubator with a shared workspace for ai startups and mentorship\" ( [1]   [2] )    lots of good labeled data (reliable ground truth) is the key to success with ai ( [1]   [2]   [3]   [4] )    ai in the real world is a lot harder than ideal conditions in part because you see crazy things like robots getting attacked by humans ( [1]   [2] )    \"the google [chrome] ad-blocker will block all advertising on sites that have a certain number of unacceptable ads, according to the wall street journal. that includes ads that have pop-ups, auto-playing video, and prestitial count-down ads that delay the display of content.\" ( [1] )     nice acm queue article from google sres on availability as a combination of subservice reliability, rapid recovery, and setting expectations ( [1] )    \"designing a [software] library to reduce cognitive load is still the exception, not the rule\" ( [1]   [2] )     a lesson for bigger companies, investing in the long-term with your researchers, who are often working a few years ahead of what youll need now ( [1] )     wow: \"the melts blundering trajectory is instructive  entrepreneurs frequently embark on these missions with vast sums of money and a deep belief in technologys power to solve all problems\u200a\u200awhich is not always a formula for success . they were all good people, and they all wanted good things. they just didnt know anything about running restaurants.\" ( [1] )    \"the once-hot social network was built on the idea that people would enjoy having anonymous conversations with people close by. thats a fantastic concept until you remember that anonymous internet person and by definition near you are scary as hell in practice.\" ( [1] )    great teardown of the juicero, includes some excellent business advice on iterative development and testing your ideas on real customers ( [1]   [2] )    \"when the us government discovers a vulnerability   it can keep it secret and use it offensively  or it can alert the software vendor and see that the vulnerability is patched, protecting the country  every offensive weapon is a (potential) chink in our defense.\" ( [1] )    on spearfishing attacks: \"by a careful design and timing of a message, it should be possible to make virtually any person click\" ( [1]   [2] )    schneier on forging voices: \"i dont think were ready for this. we use peoples voices to authenticate them all the time, in all sorts of different ways.\"\ufeff ( [1] )    facebook says, \"we have had to expand our security focus to include more subtle and insidious forms of misuse, including attempts to manipulate civic discourse and deceive people\" ( [1]   [2] )    remarkable and concerning that this is possible: \"by accessing accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, the web-hosted javascript measures subtle changes in a phones angle, rotation, movement speed, and similar characteristics. the data, in turn, can reveal sensitive information about the phone and its user  [including] the keystrokes being entered\" ( [1] )    nice high level description here of the difference between what apple and google are doing for privacy-preserving machine learning. in brief, apple adds noise to the data to preserve privacy, but google learns on the device then sends the updates to the machine learned models back (much like parameters servers in deep learning). the truth is theyre probably both doing both, but its still a good thing to think about. ( [1] )    using battery backup to optimize gas power plants by being able to skip the expensive bits for gas turbines, sitting in standby because of lengthy startup times. its easy and practical, a nice example of low hanging fruit with major impact. ( [1] )     good data on the projected costs of energy sources ( [1] )    good data on the newspaper industry. theres a curious spike in ad revenue from 1980-2000 that isnt matched by subscriptions. ( [1] )    jeff bezos is making journalism profitable: \"the post has said that it was profitable last year  and not through cost-cutting  the post has gone on a hiring spree. it has hired hundreds of reporters and editors and has more than tripled its technology staff  third straight year of double-digit revenue growth  you have to be great at technology. you have to be great at monetization. but one thing i think were proving is that if you are, great journalism can be profitable.\" ( [1] )    how google took over the classroom, great article, but misses that the failure of ipads was a big piece of this ( [1]   [2] )    duolingos excellent efforts to help people learn english, which can be a tool for economic or educational advancement ( [1] )    amazon web services cuts prices again, remarkable ( [1] )    almost all cloud workloads right now are not cloud optimized, so the customers mostly moved a system built for fixed hardware resources to the cloud and then run idle a lot rather than redesigning to optimize with dynamically scaling ( [1] )    latest version of google earth is impressive, definitely worth trying ( [1] )    brent smith and i received the first ever ieee internet computing test of time award for our 2003 paper on amazons recommender system. in a new article for the ieee internet computing 20th anniversary issue, we look back at the last two decades. ( [1] )    a virtual reality game that succeeds at taking advantage of what it can do well and what it cant to create a fully immersive experience ( [1] )     somehow, i missed that chris sacca is retiring. amazing career and influence he had, and impressive to decide to go an entire new direction now. ( [1] )    in a stack overflow survey, what software engineers care about, its who they work with, what they are doing, and what they learn far more than salary. in the top five items, three are about who you work with and what you learn, one is benefits, and one is commute. but the benefits are complicated -- its not salary, stock, and bonus -- but the top items all things related to work environment and commute, vacation, and health care. ( [1] )    great interview with the ceo of coursera: \"humility and the ability to listen well are the big things i look for  if you want to understand people, you need to hear them  [also have] ambitious goals to lift the organization up and everybody with it. setting goals that are ambitious but also achievable is an important skill.\" ( [1] )    great quote from jeff: \"at amazon, weve had a lot of inventions that we were very excited about, and customers didnt care at all. and believe me, those inventions were not disruptive in any way. the only thing thats disruptive is customer adoption.\" ( [1] )    nice line in dan arielys book payoff: \"if you really want to demotivate people, shredding their work is the way to go, but  you can get almost all the way there simply by ignoring their efforts.\" ( [1] )    xkcd points out minor changes in methodology yield radical changes in data visualizations of most unusually popular activity in a location ( [1] )    xkcd on machine learning, disturbingly close to reality ( [1] )    xkcd on hard problems ( [1] )    xkcd on survivorship bias ( [1] )    xkcd on unhelpful code reviews ( [1] )    very funny that burger king ran an ad with \"ok, google\" and it works. once again xkcd was hilariously prescient about this. ( [1]   [2] )    smbc comic on bayesian inference: \"given his low priors\" ( [1] )    smbc comic: \"then it occurred to me, hey, ive got like a sample size of one here, and its not double blind.\" ( [1] )    smbc comic on behavioral economics ( [1] )    smbc comic: \"wait, are you going to turn my lifes work into a joke about butts or something?\"  [1] )", "kwds": ["some", "of", "the", "tech",

( [1]   [2]   [3] )    artificial intelligence expert yann lecun says, \"there have been, on the face of it, impressive demonstrations, [but] those are not as impressive as they look  they dont have common sense  one of the things we really want to do is get machines to acquire the very large number of facts that represent the constraints of the real world just by observing it through video or other channels. thats what would allow them to acquire common sense, in the end.\" ( [1] )     genetic algorithms and neural networks are back. it feels like the 1990s all over again. ( [1] )     bringing more novices to ai now is the way to get more experts and advances later ( [1] )    nice results from focusing on errors that matter to people, the perceived quality of the system by humans, not theoretical accuracy ( [1]   [2] )     success often comes from trying many things: \"start  with a hazy intuition or vision  after a lot of trial and error they get closer and closer to discovering what their idea is  seeking novelty instead of objectives is risky  not every interesting thread will pay off  but  the potential payoffs are higher.\" ( [1] )    research includes people able to do things no one else can, including having data or compute at the frontier beyond what anyone else has done before ( [1]   [2] )    6.3m virtual reality headsets sold in 2016, but almost all so far just the cheap toys where you slot your smartphone in to use as the screen ( [1]   [2] )    \"total [tablet] sales sinking 15.6%, year on year, with sales of 174.8m units in 2016 compared to 2015s 207.2m\" ( [1] )    for the first time, more people in the us using netflix than a dvr: \"54 percent of us adults reporting they have netflix in their households compared to the 53 percent of us adults that have dvr\" ( [1] )      the economist: \"amazons heady valuation resembles a self-fulfilling prophecy. the company will be able to keep spending, and its spending will keep making it more powerful\" ( [1] )    \"what has surprised aws as the cloud has evolved  i dont think in our wildest dreams we ever thought wed have a six- to seven-year head start\" ( [1] )     and that is true in retail for amazon as well ( [1]   [2]   [3] )     \"yahoo is perhaps most famous for destroying all of its best social properties. from its hideous deformations of flickr and neglect of upcoming to its starvation of delicious and torment of geocities users, the company excelled at buying great things and turning them into unusable parodies of themselves. execs seemed to profoundly misunderstand why people used the sites they bought.\" ( [1] )    \"google will account for 78 percent of search ad revenue in 2017, while facebook will get 39 percent of display ad revenue. everyone else  is fighting over the scraps.\" ( [1] )    culture is created by what you publicly reward, not what you say ( [1]   [2]   [3] )    \"the problem with bad processes is that they institutionalize inefficiency. they ensure that things will be done the wrong way, over and over and over again\" ( [1]   [2] )    \"burnout begins when a worker feels overwhelmed for a sustained period of time, then apathetic and ultimately numb . workers who used to take the lead on projects grow taciturn during meetings. top performers start coming in late, leaving early and watch their careers stall  burnout is claiming victims at work, and companies arent ready to cope\" ( [1] )    a lot of companies have merely medium data, not big data: \"hundreds of enterprises were hugely disappointed by their useless 2 to 10tb hadoop clusters  their data works better in other technologies\" ( [1] )    lack of incentives leads to poor internet of things security ( [1] )    as javascript ages, it repeats many of the problems of the past: \"using data from over 133k websites, we show that 37% of them include at least one library with a known vulnerability\" ( [1] )    \"what are some things you wish you knew when you started programming?\" ( [1]   [2] )     many xkcd comics are both funny and prescient, and this one on encryption seems particularly relevant right now ( [1] )    xkcd comic on friends that have an amazon echo ( [1] )    smbc comic on \"existential sort\". dont miss the hovertext: \"also, any list can be immediately sorted by just pretty much being fine with it the way it

or help others manage people.    id summarize it by saying it takes a teaching and mentoring approach to management, very much of the school that managers primarily exist to help the people on their team. the advice is both practical and actionable, with specific advice for running 1:1s and meetings, and focused how to encourage conversations where people strive to improve themselves as well as helping others.    some carefully selected quotes from the book:    \"it seems obvious that good bosses must care personally about the people who report directly to them  and yet  \"    \"it turns out that when people trust you and believe you care about them, they are much more likely to accept and act on your praise and criticism, tell you what they really think about what you are doing well and, more importantly, not doing so well, engage in this same behavior with one another  embrace their role on the team, and focus on getting results\"    \"when youre the boss, its awkward to ask your direct reports to tell you frankly what they think of your performance, even more awkward for them than it is for you. to help, i [ask]  is there anything i could do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?  it is essential that you  commit to sticking with the conversation until you have a genuine response. one technique is to count to six before saying anything else, forcing them to endure the silence. the goal is not to bully but to insist on a candid discussion  then listen with the intent to understand  once youve asked your question and embraced the discomfort and understood the criticism, you have to follow up by showing that you welcome it. you have to reward the candor if you want to get more of it  make a chance as soon as possible  show youre trying.\"    \"if you can absorb the blows, the members of your team are more likely to be good bosses to their employees when they have them  the rewards of watching people you care about flourish and then help others flourish.\"    \"the ultimate goal of radical candor is to achieve results collaboratively that you could never achieve individually  a culture of guidance  an exemplary team  self-correcting quality whereby most problems are solved before you are even aware of them  dont start by bossing people. theyll just hate you. start by listening to them.\"\ufeff", "kwds": ["this", "just", "came",

( [1]   [2] )       not sure how well known this is: \"facebook collects information about pages [you] visit that contain facebook sharing buttons  and in case that wasnt enough, facebook also buys data about its users mortgages, car ownership and shopping habits from some of the biggest commercial data brokers. facebook uses all this data to offer marketers a chance to target ads to increasingly specific groups of people. indeed, we found facebook offers advertisers more than 1,300 categories for ad targeting  everything from people whose property size is less than .26 acres to households with exactly seven credit cards.\" ( [1] )       interesting example for the news industry: \"doubling down on traditional journalism and investing heavily in new ways to deliver it, through smartphone apps, voice-activated speakers and e-readers. the posts digital effort has become the envy of the industry, with as many as 80 software engineers, developers and others working alongside reporters and editors to present the news in real time.\" ( [1] )       \"bezos has worked to create a culture at amazon thats hospitable to experimentation  developing products customers will actually want to pay for  experiments start small and grow over time  a small team to experiment with the idea and find out if its viable  if a team succeeds in smaller challenges, its given more resources and a larger challenge to tackle  prioritize launching early over everything else  learn as quickly as possible whether an idea that sounds good on paper is actually a good idea in the real world  getting a product into the hands of paying customers as quickly as possible and taking their feedback seriously  avoids wasting years working on products that dont serve the needs of real customers.\" ( [1] )       new direction for the cloud, just small pieces of code running somewhere (you dont care where) and data stored somewhere (you dont care where), all auto scaled ( [1]   [2] )        \"many failed ideas have been resuscitated and rebranded as successful products and services, owned and managed by people other than their originators. behind almost every popular app or website today lie numerous shadow versions that have been sloughed away by time. yet recognition of the group nature of the enterprise would undermine a myth that legitimizes the consolidation of profit, for the most part, among a small group of people.\" ( [1] )      for those of us tracking virtual reality: \"while facebook does not provide sales figures for the $599 oculus rift headset  analysts believe they are slow. one research firm  estimated the company sold only about 355,000 by the end of last year.\"\ufeff ( [1]   [2]   [3] )      a surprising level of detail here on what software development is like inside of google. i agree with most of it, and highly recommend reading at least section 2. ( [1]   [2] )       great blog post summarizing nips 2016. highlights are what wins kaggle competitions, why deep learning works, latest twiddles to deep learning and reinforcement learning, why dialogs (chat) still doesnt work, and that baidu has products whos only value is in the data they collect (not direct revenue, just the explore part of explore/exploit, learning how to be more effective). ( [1] )       ease of use is badly underrated: \"using tensorflow makes me feel like im not smart enough to use tensorflow; whereas using keras makes me feel like neural networks are easier than i realized.\" ( [1] )       new paper by geoff hinton and jeff dean, essentially a very large ensemble of neural networks with sparsity enforced to minimize the computational cost ( [1] )       thoughtful comments on engineering management ( [1] )       different people we work with in tech tend to have different ideas of what it means to get things done ( [1] )       \"people with different backgrounds bring new information. simply interacting with individuals who are different forces group members to prepare better, to anticipate alternative viewpoints and to expect that reaching consensus will take effort.\" ( [1] )       meetings are expensive -- a 10 person meeting for an hour costs a few thousand dollars -- and people hate meetings too. some good reoccurring themes here are to keep meetings small, short, write a tight agenda ahead of time, stay off your laptop and phone, and try to finish early. ( [1] )       disappointing game theory tidbit of the day, the joy of destruction game shows people enjoy causing harm when they can do it without consequences ( [1]   [2] )        great data visualizations from 538, not just eye candy but convey information quickly ( [1] )         \"tesla has 1.3 billion miles of car-driving data thanks to its autopilot-equipped vehicles that are already on the road before competitors in detroit and silicon valley can roll self-driving cars off the lot. its a massive competitive advantage.\" ( [1] )       fun details on laying undersea internet cables from amazon web services distinguished engineer james hamilton ( [1] )       \"all future wars will begin as cyberwars\" ( [1] )       impressive plans from chinas space program, probes on the far side of the moon and on mars in the next four years ( [1] )       for those interested in education, mits popular and excellent scratch has published a dataset of how people learn computational thinking ( [1] )       what code.org has achieved is very impressive: \"trained 50,000 new k-12 computer science teachers  more than 20 million lines of code have been written by  more than one million k-12 students  we expect to dramatically change the demographics of ap computer science this year\" ( [1] )       funny article from the onion on having too many browser tabs open ( [1] )       smbc comic on the universe as a/b testing ( [1] )       smbc comic on behavioral economics and anchoring ( [1] )       smbc comic: \"the wise man was put to death in the most mathematically insulting

{"feed_name": "Geeking with Greg", "is_blog": true, "img_loc": "http:https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_jqKeF7Otx8/WEwxYE06oRI/AAAAAAAAgNU/HtrojbDaAe0-_FN8bp8mjZ3tgpq1MqsDgCLcB/s1600/51FAKHDS4WL.jpg", "pub_datetime": "2018-02-16 22:06:22", "summary": "cynical, mercenary, and dark,  this book  aptly serves as an opposing view for any idealism you may have been feeling about silicon valley startups or their bigger brethren. some of us work in technology to make a difference. that is not what you will find in this book.    it is a tale of a startup that wasnt really a startup, three people with no real product acquired after 10 months. it is a tale of sales and personal marketing, spinning unfavorable realities into golden-sounding tales capable of jumping the next hurdle and moving on to the next deal. it is a tale of greed and personal ambition, everything viewed through a wall street lens of climbing a hierarchy of wealth and power, some in the world of venture capital, and particularly detailed at facebook.    facebook comes out of the book particularly poorly, as if zuck is a some kind of fickle boy king holding court with his sycophants. during his time at facebook, the author appears to try to join this clique, only to grow bitter when entry is rebuffed.    most interesting is the description of facebooks struggle with advertising revenue, especially after its ipo. as the author describes it, facebook couldnt figure out how to make the promised revenue. eventually, in mid-2013 or so, they found a way, not by using data on what people do, but knowing who most people are, which turned out to be particularly important on mobile (\"basic targeting like age and gender was a godsend to data-starved marketers  data-wise, you have a first-party relationship with [only] a few apps\"). the real value of facebook turned out not to be its data on what people are doing, but merely being able to identify most people consistently and willing to exploit that to its fullest.    it helps if you know at least a few of the personalities featured in the book. paul graham, sam altman, chris sacca, greg badros, and many others make at least brief appearances, usually to get splattered with the slime that drips from these pages. many vcs and people at facebook and twitter are also mentioned, mostly described as the amoral whos who of the rich and powerful of silicon valley.    like many who got lucky, the author confuses luck with skill. sure, that pitch meeting went well, but that meeting almost didnt happen. success often was a result of a chance connection at the right time. in cases where the author angered someone with his arrogance or foolishness, someone should have killed the deal, and might have had they been in a slightly different mood that day. this startup was almost stillborn, barely making it into y-combinator. the acqui-hire almost didnt happen, almost killed by lack of customer growth and shenanigans by the author. that everything worked out even as well as it did was mostly good fortune.    to his credit, the author realizes some of this in the end. in the acknowledgments, he writes, \"lets be blunt: ours was a relationship of pure convenience, and i exploited you as much as you did me.\" but he also writes of some he encountered, \"in a valley world awash with mammoth greed and opportunism masquerading as beneficent innovation, you were the only real loyalty and idealism i ever encountered.\" id like to think mammoth greed and opportunism have much smaller representation than idealistic innovation.    some may call me wishful, but i think pushing for that idealistic world to be true is part of making it true. this book is not going to stop me from thinking that tech companies should be a force for idealistic innovation and promise for the future. at least in my circles, most people i talk with are awash with idealism, a genuine belief that what they are working on can make things better for others. it saddens me to see that the authors perception of the tech industry is so different than my own.", "kwds": ["cynical", "mercenary", "and", "dark", " ", "this", "book", " ", "aptly",

of personalization and recommendations save us more than $1b per year\" ( [1]   [2]   [3] )      \"the main reasons cited for using ad blockers include avoiding disruptive ads (69%), ads that slow down their browsing experience (58%) and security / malware risks (56%). privacy wasnt the top answer. so facebook thinks if its can make its ads non-interruptive, fast, [useful,] and secure, people wont mind.\" ( [1]   [2] )       according to the nyt, uber lost $1.2b on $2.1b in revenue in h1 2016 ( [1]   [2] )         \"amazon reaches new high of 268,900 employees  skyrocketing 47% in just one

hot again , with dedicated hardware headsets launching from multiple manufacturers intended for general use.   the world is substantially different than the  last time this happened . in particular, theres more computing power available in our smartphones than the most powerful graphics workstations had back in the 1990s. google cardboard and others take advantage of that, using a smartphone and little else for a quick-and-dirty virtual reality experience.   but, for a product to appeal to a broad market -- to get beyond early adopters with disposable income seeking to show something cool to friends a couple times -- it needs to survive the harsh judgement of busy people. it isnt enough for virtual reality on expensive dedicated hardware to mostly work. the experience will have to wow repeatedly at a price people like.   so,  daniel  and i have another  bet : \"virtual reality hardware (not counting cardboard) will not sell more than 10m units/year worldwide before march 2019.\" im saying it wont. daniel says it will. loser donates $100 to the winners choice of charity.   daniel  already posted  his side of the bet. in brief, he thinks three years will be enough time for someone to get it right.   i think that mainstream adoption of dedicated hardware for virtual reality requires breakthroughs in usability and price that are too difficult to achieve in the three year time frame. the experience just isnt good enough yet for it to be anything other than a toy for early adopters. current virtual reality hardware is bulky, expensive, not fully immersive, and not addictive or compelling beyond the initial wow. i expect even the next generation will just be a niche market (low million units per year) until we see major developments on price, form factor, and quality of the experience.   there are several wild cards here. for example, it is possible that much cheaper units can be made to work. its possible that someone discovers very carefully chosen environments and software tricks fool the brain into fully accepting the virtual reality, especially for gaming, increasing the appeal and making it a must-have experience for a lot of people. as unsavory as it is, pornography is often a wild card with new technology, potentially driving adoption in ways that can determine winners and losers. a breakthrough in display (such as retinal displays) might allow virtual reality hardware that is much cheaper and lighter. business use is another unknown where virtual reality could provide a large cost savings over physical presence. i do think there are many ways in which i could lose this bet.    like daniel , ill add some constraints to make my side of the bet even harder. id be surprised if dedicated virtual reality hardware sells more than 10m total over all three years. id also be surprised if virtual reality using smartphones (like google cardboard) goes beyond a toy, so, is used regularly by tens of millions for gaming, education, or virtual tourism.   and, like daniel, i expect virtual reality to be big eventually, am frustrated by our current computing limitations, and think we should work to have much better from our computing devices

daniel lemire and i  bet $100  over the question of whether tablets would replace pcs.   specifically, the bet  was , \"in some quarter of 2015, the unit sales of tablets will be at least twice the unit sales of traditional pcs, in the usa.\" loser donates $100 usd to the charity of the winners choice.   its 2016, and tablet sales went far higher than i ever expected, approaching pc sales, roughly 60m/year units for both tablets and pcs in the us. but tablet sales seem to have peaked, with q4 2015 unit sales worldwide actually  14% lower  than the previous year, which is worse than the  8% decline  in pc sales.   there are other surprises. one of my concerns was that a very cheap tablet would dominate the market, and amazon did come out with a $50 tablet that got  relatively good reviews  and nearly  tripled  amazons market share on tablets. there hasnt been enough time yet to see what happens with very cheap tablets, but tablets this cheap are a different category than the tablets that were around in 2012.   another concern at the time was hybrid tablets, so tablets with detachable keyboards that function a lot like laptops, and whether theyd blur the line between pc and tablet. hybrid tablets have done very well -- a major category in tablets -- and look likely to continue to grow over time.   the last concern at the time was whether tablets could thrive despite the pressure from increasingly larger and more powerful mobile phones. that seems to have been the biggest issue. phablets are getting as large as early tablets, and tablets that try to be much bigger than a smartphone proved too unwieldy and sold poorly. after all, who needs a tablet when youve got a mobile thats almost as large?   the broader question in the bet was whether people would stop using pcs. pc sales have been in decline, though the pace of that decline has slowed recently. what seems to be happening is that people are continuing to use multiple devices, which was a visible trend back in 2012.   a phone is great when you want to do something quickly on the run. a bigger screen is good when you need to do a lot of reading. a keyboard, mouse, and large screen become useful when youre producing instead of consuming. if you need to do all of these, theres no reason to only have a phone, only a tablet, or only a pc. instead, people often have  all three and more .   even though i technically won this bet, i want to congratulate  daniel lemire  on this getting much closer than i ever expected. i also admire the bravery he had to take the bet, especially with such favorable terms, and appreciate what i learned from this. the terms were that the loser donate $100 to the charity of the winners choice, and id like to match the donation. daniel and i will both be donating $100 to the wikimedia foundation, which runs wikipedia.    update : daniels post is up: \" lost my bet: the pc isnt dead yet \".", "kwds": ["in", "2012", "professor", "daniel", "lemire",

"in this post i describe the  dslabs package , which contains some datasets that i use in my data science courses. \n a much discussed topic in stats education is that computing should play a more prominent role in the curriculum. i strongly agree, but i think the main improvement will come from bringing applications to the forefront and mimicking, as best as possible, the challenges applied statisticians face in real life. i therefore try to avoid using widely used  toy examples , such as the  mtcars  dataset, when i teach data science. however, my experience has been that finding examples that are both realistic, interesting, and appropriate for beginners is not easy. after a few years of teaching i have collected a few datasets that i think fit this criteria. to facilitate their use in introductory classes, i include them in the  dslabs package : \n  install.packages(\"dslabs\")  \n below i show some example of how you can use these datasets. you can see the datasets that are included here: \n  library(\"dslabs\")\ndata(package=\"dslabs\")  \n note that the package also includes some of the scripts used to wrangle the data from their original source: \n

other people did ( 2016 , 2015 ,  2014 ,  2013 ). like in previous years im making a list, again right off the top of my head.  if you know of some, you should make your own list or add it to the comments! i have also avoided talking about stuff i worked on or that people here at hopkins are doing because this post is supposed to be about other peoples awesome stuff. i write this post because a blog often feels like a place to complain, but we started simply stats as a place to be pumped up about the stuff people were doing with data.  \n\n \n amelia mcnamara and aran lunzer made this  crazy nice illustration  of how histograms work. \n i am just continuously impressed by the work coming out of rahul satijas group - this year it was  this paper  on aligning cell populations in single cell data. \n karl broman and kara woo wrote the  definitive guide to data in spreadsheets  with the winner for most dense delivery of valuable information in a sentence in the last sentence of the abstract. \n the rest of the papers in the  peerj data science collection  are also awesome. \n thomas lin pederson came out with the  patchwork  package for composing plots. this is the plot organization software ive always wanted :). \n getting  avericked  became a word as mara averick somehow makes everything r related look  so cool . \n the folks at  fast.ai  do so many impressive things (they are mooc geniuses) its hard to list just one to list, but this  post on data ethics  might be my favorite. \n kristian lum wrote the  most important blog post in statistics  and jump-started the discussion throughout our field on the standard of behavior we want to hold ourselves to as a field. \n hadley wickham is the lebron james of data science - so effortlessly great it is almost expected.  usethis  is yet another example of how hes revolutionizing package development (again). \n i looooovveeddd this post from  julia silge  on how to do word2vec like things with tidy data. such a beautiful distillation of something complicated into something we all can do. \n i only bought one stats book all year. it was  david robinsons empirical bayes book . an insta-classic. \n ive been following nick strayers dive into deep learning all year on  twitter , this post on  lstm with a baseball analogy  is a good example of the awesomeness. \n jeff kao had a  tour de force  post on identifying fake comments on the net neutrality repeal. such an impressively timed and high impact piece of forensic data science. \n mike love released his  amazing lecture notes  for his intro to computational biology class. i want to take a class from mike. \n the  keras  r package is sooooo nice. i love everything jj allaire does - whenever he writes software it always seems like hes read my mind and the way id want the software to work it just does. \n jesse meagans post on  educational data wrangling  was realy close to my heart. plus it is so awesome to read about her (impressive) transition from excel to r. something im thinking about a ton these days. \n ive been gobbling up cristoph molnars  book on interpretable machine learning . \n the book on  tidytextmining  came out this year. what a tour-de-force from julia silge and david robinson. \n i read a lot of fastforward blog posts this year - one of my favorites was this one on  auditing machine learning models  - such an important topic. \n i love this post on the  ten fallacies of data science  - my favorite one? the data exist. \n i basically read every one of ma\u00eblle salmons blog post but i found her analysis of  seeds that people use in r  to be fascinating. im looking forward to more on the epidemiology of code :). \n i dug emily robinsons  post on making r code faster  this is something im adding to every class i teach in the future - so nice to see all the steps laid out so clearly! \n natalie telis did one of the most impressive  crowd sourced studies  of who is asking questions at the major genetics conference. i think solutions like this are so clever when they are low cost/low overhead but produce super interesting results. \n i liked stephen turners updated post on  how to stay current in bioinformatics . keeping up is super hard to do well - so this is a big service for the community. \n its hard to point to just one thing karthik ram does for the r community in any given year, but i was pumped to see this call for  ropensci fellows . i know im going to hit peak fomo whenever karthik is organizing. \n my main goal as an advisor is to be like  marta kutas -  i dont care what they become, she says of her students, so long as its decent, thinking human beings!  \n im such a fan of rob hyndmans forcasting work, and was pumped to see him on  datacamp . the data camp folks have been just vacuming up awesome people to teach courses. \n andrew bream did an amazing, polite, and thorough job of  setting me straight on deep learning . \n the  upsetr  package was a heartwarming contribution for those of us who are terrified of out of control venn diagrams. * i think florian markowetz consistently is one of the most thoughtful computational scientists. i read his stuff relentelessly but loved his idea for a  pre-registration of the human cell atlas . \n it was the year of  datasaurus ! i am in the process of replacing all my anscomb quartet lecture notes. what a cool idea by justin matejka and george fitzmaurice. \n there are times when i wonder whether emma pierson has created multiple ai copies of herself. how can one person write  so ,  many ,  awesome ,  things  in one year? \n ben haibe-kains and colleagues put together a tour-de-force in reproducibility  with pharmacodb . \n there is often talk of how academic statistics isnt supportive enough of non-standard (read: non-math) contributions. there is definitely truth there, but i love  lance waller  on navigating these non-standard paths in academics. \n i am so amped about the  skimr  package, especially the histograms as part of the summary statistics. \n christie aschwanden added another  awesome piece  to her collection of the most level-headed, responsible, and thoughtful discusison of the statistical issues in science. \n \n\n thats all i have for the moment. im sure i missed a ton and im sorry if i missed you - please add more in the comments i always love to see cool stuff!",

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "is_blog": true, "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-12-20 00:00:00", "summary": "note: this post was originally published as part of a collection of discussion pieces on david donohos paper. the  original paper  and collection of discussions can be found at the  jcgs web site .  \n\n professor donohos commentary comes at a perfect time, given that, according to his own chronology, we are just about due for another push to widen the tent of statistics to include a broader array of activities. looking back at the efforts of people like tukey, cleveland, and chambers to broaden the meaning of statistics, i would argue that to some extent their efforts have failed. if you look at a textbook for a course in a typical phd program in statistics today, i believe it would look much like the textbooks used by cleveland, chambers, and tukey in their own studies. in fact, it might even be the same textbook! progress has been slow, in my opinion. but why is that? why cant statistics grow to more fully embrace the many activities that professor donoho describes in his six divisions of greater data science? \n\n one frustration that i think many statisticians have in discussions of data science is that if you look at each of the six divisions that donoho lays outdata exploration, data transformation, computing, modeling, visualization, and science of data sciencestatisticians  do  all those things. but the truth is, we do not  teach  most of them. over the years, the teaching of statistics has expanded to include topics like computing and visualization, but typically as optional or ancillary courses. many of the activities on donohos list are things that students are assumed to figure out on their own without any formal instruction. asymptotic theory, on the other hand,  requires  formal instruction. \n\n in my own experience, the biggest challenge to teaching the areas of greater data science is that it is difficult and can be very inefficient. ultimately, i believe these are the reasons that we as a field choose not to teach this material. many of the areas in the six divisions, data exploration and transformation, can be frustratingly difficult to generalize. if i clean up administrative claims data from medicare and link them to air pollution data from the environmental protection agency, does any of the knowledge i gain from those activities apply to the processing of rna-seq data and linking it with clinical phenotypes? its difficult to see any connection. on the other hand, both datasets will likely serve as inputs to a generalized linear model. rather than teach one course on cleaning administrative claims data and another course on processing rna-seq data, consider how many birds can be hit with the three stones of an exponential family, a link function, and a linear predictor? furthermore, the behavior of generalized linear models can be analyzed mathematically to make incredibly useful predictions about the variability of their estimates. \n\n the lack of a formal framework for data cleaning reduces the teaching of the subject to a parade of special cases. while each case might be of interest to some, its unlikely that any case would be applicable to all. in any institution of higher learning with finite resources, its impossible to provide formal instruction on all the special cases to everybody who needs them. its much more efficient to teach the generalized linear model and the central limit theorem. \n\n is the lack of a formal framework for some areas of data science attributable to some fundamental aspect of those topics, or does it arise simply from a lack of trying? in my opinion, the evidence to date lays the blame on our fields traditional bias towards to use of mathematics as the principal tool for analysis. indeed, much of the interesting formal work being done in data cleaning and transformation makes use of a completely different toolbox, one largely drawing from computer science and software engineering. because of this different toolbox, our field has been blinded to recent developments and has missed an important opportunity to cultivate more academic leaders in this area. \n\n professor donoho rightly highlights the work of hadley wickham and yihui xie, both statisticians, who have made seminal contributions to the field of statistics in their development of the ggplot2, knitr, dplyr, and many other packages for r. it is notable that wickhams paper outlining the concept of tidy data, a concept which has sparked a minor revolution in the field of data analysis, was originally published in the journal of statistical software, a nominally applied journal. i would argue that such a paper more properly belongs in the annals of statistics than in a software journal. the formal framework offered in that paper has inspired the creation of numerous tidy data approaches to analyzing data that have proven remarkably simple to use and understand. the grammar outlined in wickhams paper and implemented in the dplyr package serve as an abstraction whose usefulness has been demonstrated in a variety of situations. the lack of mathematical notation in the presentation of dplyr or any of its tidyverse relatives does not make it less useful nor does it make it less broadly applicable. \n\n finally, it is worth a comment that the people that professor donoho cites as driving previous pushes to widen the tent of statistics either did not initially come from academia or at least straddled the boundary. cleveland, chambers, and tukey all spent significant time in industry and government settings and that experience no doubt colored their perspectives. moving to today, it might just be a coincidence that both wickham and xie are employed outside of academia by rstudio, but i doubt it. perhaps it is always the case that the experts come from somewhere else. however, i fear that

"2017-12-18 00:00:00", "summary": "sometimes, when youre recording a podcast, its actually difficult to listen. thats because while youre recording youre monitoring the network lag, the sound levels, the show notes, and the outline. on some episodes im just barely hanging on by a thread. \n\n while hilary parker and i were recording  episode 50 of not so standard deviations  we had a discussion about her experience doing a/b testing at etsy and how one experiment, which involved showing customers their passwords as they typed them, resulted in an  increase  in the number of failed login attempts, which was not what they were expecting. in the episode, we discuss how the problem was discovered and resolved and concluded that part of solving the problem involved a familiarity with how web forms can work. \n\n \n  roger : it feels like your intuition and experience using the web, and apps, andits all coming together, right? \n\n  hilary : exactlywhich is part of whyits so important for data scientists to have genuine interest in the products theyre working on. \n \n\n the idea here is that in this particular problem, an analysts experience with web forms played a significant role in interpreting and analyzing the data from the a/b test. they were then able to make modifications to the test and run it again. one thing that is interesting about this story is that understanding how web forms work has  nothing to do with the data . its what you might think of as prior knowledge. in an alternative universe, one could imagine looking at the data, seeing that login failures were increasing, and then just nixing the feature, concluding that the data had spoken. \n\n hilarys comment passed me by at the time, but now that ive had some time to consider it, i think if its true, it has profound implications for the field of data science. perhaps another way to frame it is to ask the question:  does the quality of your data analysis depend on how much you care about the problem?  its maybe not the best question because i think the answer can be both yes and no, depending on the problem. \n\n however, i think there are multi-billion dollar unicorn startups whose future depends critically on the answer being no. i wrote a little about this  in regards to palantir . at the time, i wrote that palantir was bouncing along a spectrum with boring old consulting company on one end and cool highly scalable software company on the other end.  in particular, it appeared that their expertise in some areas wasnt translating well to other areas: \n\n \n its clear that coke didnt feel comfortable collaborating with palantirs personnel. like any data science collaboration, its key that the data scientist have some familiarity with the domain. in many cases, having deep expertise in an area can give a collaborator confidence that you will focus on the things that matter to them. but developing that expertise costs money and time and it may prevent you from working with other types of clients where you will necessarily have less expertise. for example, palantirs long experience working with the us military and intelligence agencies gave them deep expertise in those areas, but how does that help them with a consumer products company? \n \n\n if palantir couldnt translate their success into multiple areas, how could it justify its multi-billion dollar valuation? \n\n not having to care about the ins and outs of a given area of data analysis means that there are dramatically fewer costs involved with getting into the area. we dont need to invest time understanding whatever products may be involved and understanding why other people like them and how other poeple use them. ultimately, i think the need to care about an area or product when doing data analysis negatively affects the profit potential of that area. \n\n   \n\n whether caring matters for data analysis also has implications for how to build a data analytic team. if you need your data analyst to be 100% committed to a product and to be fully invested, its difficult to achieve that with contractors or consultants, who are typically working on multiple projects with multiple companies. some data analysis work is arguable generic, and thus can be done without emotional investment. but separating out the parts that require caring and those that dont is arguably an important part of a data science managers job.", "kwds": ["sometimes", "when", "you", "re", "recording", "podcast", "its", "actually", "difficult", "to", "listen", "that", "because",

00:00:00", "summary": "i read two blog posts on ai over the thanksgiving break. one was a nice post discussing the challenges for ai in medicine by  luke oakden-rayder  and the other was about the need for increased focus on basic research in ai motivated by alphago by  tim harford . \n\n ive had a lot of interactions with people lately who want to take advantage of machine learning/ai in their research or business. despite the excitement around ai and the exciting results we see from sophisticated research teams almost daily - the actual extent and application of ai is much smaller. in fact, most ai usually ends up  being humans in the end . \n\n while the promise of ai/ml has never been clearer, there are still only a handful of organizations that are using the technology in a major way. sometimes even apparent success stories  turn out to be problematic . \n\n i was thinking about the lifecycle of developing an ai application. i have defined this type of application previously as having  three parts : (i) an interface to humans, (ii) a data set, and (iii) an algorithm for turning the data into interactions. i started thinking about the extension of this idea to the development of an ai application and all the steps involved. then i started thinking about potential barriers. \n\n   \n\n to develop an ai application you need a few things: \n\n \n a group of people who are willing to let you have their data. \n a technology for data capture from people (this could be as simple as a website, or an echo, or as complex as a robot). \n a data storage mechanism for collecting the raw data from this input (this could just be a database) \n a set of algorithms and scripts for organizing the data for analysis. \n a definition of the problem youd like to solve in quantitative terms - usually generated through exploratory analysis. \n an algorithm trained on a  massive data set  or at minimum trained with a  good prior or expert knowledge . \n a way to structure the responses and provide feedback either to the original users of your application or to other users (researchers or executives at a company for example). \n the pipeline to take those formatted responses and return them to the user in a way that they can take advantage of. \n \n\n i think that a lot of attention is focused on step 6 and how costly talent is for  designing ai algorithms . i think for the big players where a lot of the other steps have been solved this is for sure the limiting factor and it is no wonder that the talent war is fierce. \n\n but i think that for 95% of organizations - whether they be researchers, businesses, or individuals the problem isnt in developing the algorithm. a random forest can be fit with one line of r code and while it wont be as accurate as an expertly trained neural network on a gigantic training data set, it will be really useful. \n\n so i think that most of the roadblocks to the democratization of ai are actually in the other steps and in particular the glue between the steps. for example: \n\n \n  getting access to peoples data (step 0)  - it is very hard, even for researchers, to get access to health information if you arent deepmind and google. it can take years to deal with the bureaucracy of getting access to even simple data sets. \n  having the infrastructure to capture data (step 1)  if you arent a major player you might not even be capturing complete data from people visiting your website, let alone sensors, images, text, and everything else you would want to do to perform ai. \n  storing data centrally (step 2)  in almost all of the organizations ive talked to data are scattered and managed across multiple systems and with different protocols. just knowing where and what the data are can be a multi-month process. \n  tidying the data (step 3)  there is an entire industry of data scientists built to tackle this problem, but if you cant find the data or if the data isnt stored centrally (step 2), then this can be delayed. even if it isnt, there is rarely a standardized data tidying pipeline even in places that only have one data type - so that makes it hard to do the next step. \n  defining a question ai can answer (step 4)  i would venture to say this is maybe one of the biggest bottlenecks. to create an ai system as they currently exist a human needs to (i) define a concrete scientific/business problem, (ii) create a quantitative definition of that model, and (iii) define an objective function to optimize. this process can take a huge amount of expert/knowledgeable work. \n  fitting the algorithm (step 5)  while i think there are some commodity technologies that work well here - streamlining the process from modeling to implementation is probably where a lot of ai applications could use work. this can take a while to just get the model set up even after you know exactly what you want to fit. \n  making the model output mean something to humans (step 6)  even in the cases where we ideally want the computer to do everything (self driving cars) wed still like to summarize the choices the ai might make so humans can decide if they are ethical and how to regulate those decisions. but there is still a whole field of ai that is interpretable that needs to be developed and disseminated. so even places that have models built often struggle to communicate the results in a way that they can be used. \n  automating the use of ai models (step 7)  even if you get past all those other hurdles and have a working, interpretable ai model, you need humans to use it. whether that is a doctor using the output of a radiology scan to make diagnostic/treatment decisions, or a car that can actually drive, the last step of actually making the model useful is still a major barrier to many projects. \n \n\n i think a lot of these barriers come down to the fact that for the most part we dont have strict standards for data capture/tidying/organization/use that are used across organizations. we also dont have the glue steps between each of these components automated. so while i think that the algorithms for ai will continue to develop rapidly in accuracy and range, for organizations to keep up they will need a lot more than just a way to fit the latest model. the reason that i think some organizations are leaping so far ahead is that they already have spent a huge amount of time thinking about all the steps but the model fitting, so now they can focus their time/energy/resources on making algorithms do things we didnt imagine were possible.", "kwds": ["read", "two", "blog", "posts", "on", "ai", "over", "the", "thanksgiving", "break", "one", "was", "nice", "post", "discussing", "the", "challenges",

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "is_blog": true, "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-11-21 00:00:00", "summary": "i was listening to the effort report episode on  the messy execution of reproducible research  where they were discussing the piece about  amy cuddy in the new york times . i think both the article and the podcast did a good job of discussing the nuances of the importance of reproducibility and the challenges of the social interactions around this topic. after listening to the podcast i realized that i see a lot of posts about reproducibility/replicability, but many of them are focused on the technical side. so i started to think about compiling a list of more cultural things we can do to reduce the stress/pressure around the reproducibility crisis. \n\n im sure others have pointed these out in other places but i am procrastinating writing something else so im writing these down while im thinking about them :). \n\n \n  we can define what we mean by reproduce and replicate  different fields have different definitions of the words  reproduce  and  replicate . if you are publishing a new study we now have an  r package  that you can use to create figures that show what changed and what was the same betweeen the original study and your new work. defining concretely what was the same and different will reduce some of the miscommunication about what a reproducibility/replicability study means. \n  we can remember that replication is statistical, not deterministic  if you are doing a new study where you re-collect data according to a protocol from another group - you should not expect to get exactly the same answer. so if a result is statistically significant in one study and not significant in another,  that may be within the bounds of what wed expect to see . \n  we can remember that there is a difference between exploratory and confirmatory research  there is a reason that randomized trials are the basis for regulatory decisions by the fda and others. but if we require every single study to meet the requirements of a pre-registered, randomized, double blind controlled trial with a huge sample size we might miss some  important   discoveries . \n  we can remember that a failed replication isnt always a scientific failure  one thing roger and elizabeth point out is that many scientific studies wont replicate - nor should we expect all studies to replicate. sometimes a study is preliminary, exploratory, or the first observation of an unusual event. it may be a perfectly well executed study, and not replicate because the sample size was too small or there was an unmodeled confounder. this doesnt mean that the scientific study was a failure, it just was an observation that didnt pan out. \n  we can stop publicizing scientific results as solutions so quickly  university press offices, startup companies, and researchers stressed for funding are under pressure to label every discovery as a cure, a diagnosis, a solution to the crisis. a lot of the frustration in the scientific community arises from this overstatement of results. it is hard to escape this (for me too!) - but we can excercise skepticism about claims of solutions on the basis of single scientific papers. \n  we can be persistent and private as long as possible  like many people ive run into frustrating cases where data isnt available from a paper that has been published. i have contacted the authors only to be rebuffed. i have found that it takes work to convince them to provide the data, but i can often do it without having to resort to publicizing the problems and trying to make it adversarial. \n  we can make the realization that data is valuable but in science you dont own it  there is still discussion of  data parasites and data symbionts. i have been both a data collector and a data analyst. i realize there is frustration to releasing your data and seeing others quickly publish ideas you may have had. at the same time ive seen how frustrating it can be to see people keep their data private and inaccessable indefinitely after publication. the reality is that people do deserve credit for collecting data, but that they dont own the data they collect. \n  we should cut each other some slack  i think that a lot of the frustration around reproducibility and replicability can come from the way the problem is approached. on the one hand, if you publish a scientific paper and someone tries to reproduce or replicate your work you can realize that they are doing that because they are  interested  and try to help them. even if they find some flaws (as they inevitably will) or the study doesnt replicate (as it might not) that is not a failure by you. on the other hand if you are reproducibing or replicating, remember that the scientist on the other end is a person. that person is subject to all the same funding, publication, and promotion stresses as everyone else. so we should try not to make the discovery of reproducibility/replicability problems high profile gotchas but focus on pointing out the real scientific issues that arise and trying to move forward in a positive way. \n \n\n like many others, i have noticed that the stakes around reproducibility/replicability have been ratcheted up by social media and the  rise in the prominence of the field of reproducibility . as someone who has experienced the real stress all of this can create in the life of real scientists, id love to see if we could move forward in a way that was more positive and collaborative while we address the explosion of data in the scientific enterprise.", "kwds": ["was", "listening", "to", "the", "effort", "report", "episode", "on", " ", "the", "messy", "execution", "of", "reproducible", "research", "

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "is_blog": true, "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-11-16 00:00:00", "summary": "in my ongoing discussion in my mind about  what makes for a good data analysis , one of the ideas that keeps coming back to me is this notion of being able to reason about the data. the idea here is that its important that a data analysis allow you to understand how the  data , as opposed to other aspects of an analysis like assumptions or models, played a role in producing the outputs. i think for a given problems, some kinds of analysis do a better job of that than others. \n \n to collect garbage or not? \n programmers talk a lot about the importance of being able to reason about code, in part so that you can understand whats going on and perhaps make modifications in the future. if there are two software solutions that produce equivalent results, one might prefer the one that allows you to reason about the code and about what the software is doing, even if it is less efficient. aside from having a certain common sense logic to it, there are also important implications for maintaining the code. \n along these lines, a while back i was listening to one of my favorite podcasts, the  accidental tech podcast , when  chris lattner  made a  surprise appearance . chris previously created llvm and worked at apple where he developed the swift programming language. on this episode, around the 1 hour and 56 minute mark, lattner and john siracusa get into a discussion about memory management models for programming languages. in particular, siracusa asks lattner to discuss garbage collection versus automatic reference counting (arc), a system that lattner developed while working at apple. \n \n  john siracusa : objective-c had garbage collection, as you mentioned. eventually, objective-c dropped the garbage collection and got arc [automatic reference counting], and of course, swift doesnt have garbage collection at all. can you talk about the trade-offs there and why swift is the way it is? \n \n just as a quick summary,  garbage collection  is a system by which programmers can allocate memory for objects and not have to worry about de-allocating the memory when their done with it. the idea is that a separate process called the garbage collector periodically goes through all the memory that a program is using and checks to see if it still being used by some aspect of the program. if the memory is not being used, the garbage collector marks the memory as available so that it can be allocated for something else. if the garbage collector never ran, then eventually all the memory would get allocated and nothing would free up. \n heres how siracusa sells it: \n \n  siracusa : well, the idea [is] that memory management is completely out of the hands of the programmer, and that some magical fairy behind the scenes will make it all good for you. what youre giving up, as you mentioned beforeyou lack some amount of control \n \n if you use r, youre using an application that uses a garbage collector (originally written by  luke tierney ). if youve ever noticed that sometimes you run an operation in r that normally takes a short amount of time and it takes an unusually long time to run, thats often because r had to stop for a second or two to let the garbage collector run in the background. this stutter is the bane of all applications that use garbage collection. you can actually force the garbage collector to run in r by calling the  gc()  function (although you should never have to do that in practice). i dont think the stutter is a big issue in r, but it can be a big problem for applications that demand a fluid user experience. \n one downside of garbage collection is that it addes a random aspect to program operation. since you never know when the garbage collector is going to get called (that is based on runtime conditions), you never know when your program is going to be halted to allow the garbage collector to do its thing. the upside though is that programmers dont have to worry about memory management, which is often the source of nasty bugs. \n  automatic reference counting  is essentially a fancier version of manual memory management, where programmers have to manual allocate and deallocate. but instead, with arc the  compiler  does most of the work for you. in order to allow for this, certain restrictions must be placed on the language to allow the compiler to analyze programs and determine whether certain blocks of memory will be in use at a given time. the advantage here is that the analysis occurs at compile time, thus allowing for the running of a program to be deterministic. the downside, of course, is that the programmer has to do more deliberate thinking about memory. \n a key question then, as posed by lattner is this: \n \n  chris lattner : you said gc [garbage collection] means that you dont have to think about memory. is that true? \n \n frankly, before hearing the rest, i would have said yes, its true. but lattner continues (emphasis added): \n \n  lattner : the stutter problem, to me, isnt really the issue, even though thats what gc-haters will bring up all the time. its more about  being able to reason about when the memory goes away . the most important aspect of that is that arc gets rid of finalizers. \n \n \n if you use a garbage-collected language, you use finalizers. finalizers are the thing that gets run when your object gets destroyed. finalizers have so many problems that there are entire bodies of work talking about how to work around problems with finalizers. \n \n \n for example, the finalizer gets run on the wrong thread, it has to get run multiple times, the object can get resurrected while the finalizers running. it happens non-deterministically later. you cant count on it, and so you cant use it for resource management for database handles and things like that, for example. there are so many problems with finalizers that arc just defines [it] away by having deterministic destruction. \n \n even without knowing what a finalizer is, its clear that theres a lot of complexity involved with using a garbage collector. lattners final point is critical: \n \n  lattner : theres this question of if youre building a large scale system, do you want people to never think about memory? do you want them to think about memory all the time, like they did in objective-cs classic manual retain-and-release? or do you want something in the middle? \n \n his argument is that arc is that something in the middle. \n \n  lattner : i think that arc strikes a really interesting balance, whether its in objective-c or swift. i look at manual retain-and-release as being a very imperative style of memory managementwhere youre telling the code, line by linethis is what you should do at this point in time. \n \n \n arc then takes that model and bubbles it up a big step, and it makes it be a very declarative model. the cool thing about that to me is that not only does it get rid of the mechanics of maintaining reference counting and define away tons of bugs by doing that, it also means that it is now explicit in your code what your intention was. thats something that people who maintain your code benefit from. \n \n the promise of garbage collection is clear:  the programmer doesnt have to think about memory . lattners criticism is that when building large-scale systems the programmer  always  has to think about memory, and as such, garbage collection makes it  harder  to do so. the goal of arc is to make it easier for other people to understand your code and to allow programmers to reason clearly about memory. \n \n \n what about data? \n what does any of this have to do with data analysis? well, nothing, directly. but i think there is an analogous spectrum of techniques in data analysis. in programming, one can think of garbage collection (no thinking) on one end of the spectrum and manual memory management (constantly thinking) on the other end. with data analysis, there are certain black box-type procedures proposed on one end and, well, just an uncoordinated jumble of procedures on the other end of the spectrum. \n when i mention black box-type procedures, im not referring to machine learning prediction models, which are often derided as black boxes because of their complexity. rather, im thinking of a way of doing data analysis that focuses primarily on outcomes and results. with these kinds of approaches, the discussion is almost entirely focused on whether the outcomes are correct or not, which i think is misguided in many scientific contexts. with prediction models, at least initially, it makes sense to focus on outcomes. but with data analysis, we often want to know more about how the data are connected to those outcomes. \n one famous example of how seemingly equivalent methods can diverge is  anscombes quartet . anscombe presented four datasets that have exactly the same summary statistics but appear very different when plotted. in particular, the correlations for the four datasets are the same. my take from his paper is that computing a correlation coefficient provides a  result  and the correlation will provide you some information about the data. we could have endless discussions about whether this result is correct, whether it truly exists in the population, whether it might replicate in the next study, or whether we should have used some other correlation metric. but none of that matters once you make a scatterplot of the data. the scatterplots show you  how  the data inform the result. in this case, there are four different ways in which the data can inform a given correlation coefficient, some of which are perhaps more concerning than others. \n the scatterplots in anscombes quartet allow us to reason about the data in a way that the correlation coefficient alone does not. they tell us more about what is going on with the data and aid us in interpreting the correlation coefficient. in this case, i think an analysis that includes the scatterplots is a  better data analysis  than one that does not. of course, the scatterplots alone may not be sufficient because they dont actually give you a number, which may be needed in subsequent analyses. but theres nothing that says you cant do both. \n this is more than simply saying that you should make plots (although you  should ). when you run a simple linear regression, there are two contributing parts: (a) the data and (b) the assumption of linearity. reporting the regression coefficient gives you a sense of the strength of the relationship between the predictor and the response, but does that relationship arise from the data or from the models assumptions? any analysis that can help the reader elicit the relative contributions of those two components is better than an analysis that doesnt. \n \n \n evaluating data analysis \n interestingly, anscombe laid out four myths that he hoped to debunk: \n \n  numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough;  \n  for any particular kind of statistical data there is just one set of calculations constituting a correct statistical analysis;  \n  performing intricate calculations is virtuous, whereas actually looking at the data is cheating.  \n \n unfortunately, i think these three ideas are alive and well in much of the world of data analysis, especially points 2 and 3. in discussions with various people about what makes for a good data analysis, ive found theres a common focus on correctness. for example, if a data analysis leads to a result that later replicates, then the original analysis is a good one. its hard to be against correctness, but i think its misguided. in particular, the correctness of a scientific claim cannot usually be evaluated with a single study, so this would imply that you cannot evaluate the data analysis that went into making that claim. if a replication study occurs 10 years later, that would imply that we will be waiting 10 years to determine if a data analysis is good. \n i think it should be possible to evaluate the quality of a data analysis once its done, not 10 years later when a replication study verifies a scientific claim. one way to do so is to ask whether the analysis allows us to reason about the data relative to another possible analysis. if we can answer the question, how do the data in this study inform the result? then i think we are in good shape.", "kwds":

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "is_blog": true, "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-10-30 00:00:00", "summary": "i just got back from the  ropensci ozunconf  that was run in melbourne last week. id like to give a big thanks to the organizers (nick tierney, di cook, rob hyndman and others) for putting on a great unconference. these events are always a great opportunity to meet people just getting started in the r community and to get them involved. \n\n as is typical for these unconferences, topic ideas were pitched via issues on the  ozunconf github repo . one issue that i filed was titled  how do you pitch r to new users? . while this issue was not taken up during the unconference (for good reason, i think), nick was kind enough to initiate a lunch time discussion of the topic (with  daniel falster  kindly taking notes). \n\n the topic came up in my mind because ive found that ive had to change the way that i sell r to new users. through various discussions at the unconference and in many other venues, ive found that many r users, even today, are the lone r user in their group/institution/organization. while they may enjoy using r, its often made difficult by the fact that others in their group do not use r and therefore there is some negotiation over how things get done. convincing others in the group to use r is one way to go (i suppose abandoning r is the other) and the question of how best to do this for different audiences is the question that arose in my mind. as a teacher, you can usually design the curriculum so that the students are forced to use r. but in most other environments, a different approach is needed. \n\n as part of the introduction to the topic, i talked about how i used to convince others to use r. bear in mind, this was almost 20 years ago and the majority of people i was talking to were using sas, stata, spss, excel, or some other commercial package. these were largely interactive packages, perhaps with graphical user interfaces, designed to do more or less traditional statistical analyses. my pitch usually involved three things: \n\n \n   free . r was both free as in cost and free as in  free software . the free cost part made it a highly accessible package and the free software part allowed for anyone to tinker with the package, inspect its code, and make improvements.  \n\n   graphics .  r was able to produce high quality publication ready graphics and it gave you detailed control over all the graphical elements. s-plus could also do this but s-plus didnt come with the free part mentioned above.  \n\n   programming language . unlike packages like sas, stata, or spss, r came with a robust and sophisticated lisp-like programming language that was well-suited for data analysis applications. in addition, you could use it to build packages that could extend the core r system.  \n \n\n much has changed since those early days and ive varied my pitch quite a bit to focus on a few different things (that didnt exist back then). in particular, the audience has changedi talk to many more people who are just getting started in data analysis and therefore are a bit more open-minded about which software to use. also, python has come on the scene as a viable alternative to r for data science and so there are even more arguments to consider. some of the things i focus on now are \n\n \n   reproducibility  and reporting . with the development of knitr and its combination with r markdown, the writing of reproducible reports was made infinitely easier. (markdown itself, probably deserves its own discussion, but its not specifically r-related.)  \n\n   rstudio . the development of the rstudio ide has made getting started with r much easier. having a powerful ide was important to me for learning other languages and im glad r finally has something solid for itself. rstudio has significantly simplified the development of r packages via devtools and roxygen2. while its not yet perfect, these tools have changed what used to be a labor-intensive and finicky process into a more manageable and easier to learn work flow.  \n\n   graphics . r still has the ability to make great data graphics and with the introduction of  ggplot2 , it has become easier to make good graphics.  \n\n   r packages and community . with over 10,000 packages on cran alone,  theres pretty much a package to do anything . more importantly, the people contributing those packages and the greater r community have expanded tremendously over time, bringing in new users and pushing r to be useful in more applications. eveyr year now there are probably hundreds if not thousands of meetups, conferences, seminars, and workshops all around the world, all related to r.  \n \n\n discussion \n\n at the unconference, a number of people had different approaches to how to convince others to use r. here are just a summary: \n\n \n someone mentioned the  bioconductor , which is a huge resource for those doing research in the world of high throughput biology. not many other packages have something similar so it makes an obvious selling point to people working in this area \n the idea of using r end-to-end came up, meaning using r to clean up messy data and taking it all the way to some interactive shiny app on the other end. the idea that you can use the same tool to do all the things in between made for a compelling case for r. \n for the spreadsheet audience, the  dplyr  package was sometimes a good selling point. the idea here was that you could show people how much time could be saved by automating analyses and using  dplyr  to clean up data. \n the open source nature of r came up a few times, primarily as a means for developing transferable skills. if you work at a company/institution that specializes in some proprietary package, its often difficult to transfer those skills somewhere else if your new job doesnt use that package. the fact that r is open source means that, in theory, you could use it anywhere and the skills that you build up in r are (again, in theory) applicable everywhere. \n someone mentioned that if you want to convince someone to learn/use r, just show them the multitude of jobs available to r programmers (and in particular, the salaries attached to them). \n the fact that r is obtainable for free is still important, given that matlab and sas licenses have not gotten any cheaper over time. in my experience, this is particularly important in non-industrialized countries where for many people paying for expensive licenses is not an option. \n \n\n this just a brief summary of our discussion at the unconference and i was heartened to see all of the enthusiasm for r there. even with rs incredible growth over the last 20 years, there will still come a time when a case needs to be made to use r over something else. im just glad that we have so many more reasons today than we used to.", "kwds": ["just", "got", "back",

{"feed_name": "Simply Statistics", "is_blog": true, "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2017-10-09 00:00:00", "summary": "on the latest episode of  not so standard deviations  i talked with hilary about apples efforts to train machine learning algorithms in their face id technology in the iphone x. the gist of face id is that it recognizes your face using a mathematical representation and then unlocks the phone when it can confirm that it is you. in its keynote presentation, apple mentioned that its using machine learning to do this and even had developed its own custom chips to do the computations. \n\n there were many questions regarding face id, including how exactly apple had trained this machine learning model without it ever being released to the public. there were natural concerns that the system would only recognize certain kinds of faces, perhaps of certain ethnic backgrounds or of certain shapes or sizes. two bits of evidence indicate that apple likely spent a lot of money in this training process. the first bit comes from craig federighi, senior vice president for software engineering, in an  interview with tech crunch , \n\n \n phil [schiller] mentioned that wed gathered a billion images and that wed done data gathering around the globe to make sure that we had broad geographic and ethnic data sets. both for testing and validation for great recognition rates, says federighi. that wasnt just something you could go pull off the internet. \n\n especially given that the data needed to include a high-fidelity depth map of facial data. so, says federighi, apple went out and got consent from subjects to provide scans that were quite exhaustive. those scans were taken from many angles and contain a lot of detail that was then used to train the face id system. \n \n\n the second bit of information comes from the  accidental tech podcast  where a listener wrote in to describe a study that he had recently enrolled in that took very detailed images of his face. although there is no explicit connection, it would sound by the description that this study could have been related to the face id efforts (you can hear casey liss discuss the study <a href=\"accidental tech podcast: 240: undefined wait period\nhttps://overcast.fm/+cdqobnmk/1:15:23\">here ). apparently, the study was being conducted by  exponent  which from its web site appears to be a scientific and technical consulting firm. \n\n given the two bits of information, i dont think its a stretch to say that \n\n \n  apple decided it needed a huge dataset to train the face id algorithm and that no such dataset existed that they could access  \n\n  having no real desire to collect such data themselves, apple outsourced the study to a third party company (in much the same way a biotech company might outsource a clinical trial to a clinical research organization) to collect the data to their specifications. the outsourcing also allowed apple to shield its identity in the process so that they could keep the whole face id system secret.  \n\n  the collected dataset (and the subsequently trained model) effectively serve as the prior distribution in a complex classification scheme that is adapted to a specific user once a user allows the iphone x to collect their face data.  \n \n\n apple claims that user data is not sent back to apple for privacy reasons, so that the big model is not updated according to user data. perhaps apple will continue to collect data separately from user data, but there was no mention of that. \n\n if any of this is true, there are a few things worth noting: \n\n \n  this is not the way things are done silicon valley these days. a perhaps less costly way would be to give some app away for free (like a fun game or something similar), let the app take a bunch of pictures of you from different angles, and then gather all the data to train a model. of course, such an approach would be subject to the selection bias that all approaches like this suffer from, because the data only represents the people whom the company could get to use the product.  \n\n  it must have been very expensive to conduct this study, although that is less of a big deal when you have  over $150 billion in net cash . that said, only a handful of companies could afford to do this and certainly not your average startup.  \n\n  if the face id system works well and is capable of recognizing the diversity of faces that represent the iphone customer base, then it would suggest that getting this kind of machine learning right  costs a lot of money . in particular, it highlights the limitations of crowdsourcing-as-data-collection and it would suggest that old-fashioned ideas of sampling and experimental design are still needed once in a while.  \n \n\n is it research? \n\n on twitter, someone mused that wouldnt it be nice if they released all this data to the public? certainly, it would be a valuable and unique resource if they did and would likely spur a wealth of new innovations. of course, this will almost certainly not happen, if only because apple considers this dataset a key to their competitive advantage in the area of face detection, which they believe is the future of authentication. why give this up to their competitors? indeed, i dont think anyone would expect apple to give up this dataset any more than we might expect google to give up data it collects from its search engine. \n\n on the other hand, if i had conducted a study collecting similar face information (albeit on a smaller scale!) and published a paper about my findings about face morphology, there would likely be an expectation of me to release my data to the public along with the findings. and  rightly so ! reproducibility is critical to moving science forward and releasing the data allows others to reproduce the findings. furthermore, such a dataset would likely be useful to others investigations and would benefit all of science. \n\n but why is there is no expectation for apple to release data from its study but there is an expectation on me to release data from my study? \n\n in my opinion, apple is not conducting research, even though it kind of looks like it is. rather, apple is doing product development, which requires some gathering of information as part of the process. the fact that the information gathering was done on such a large scale isnt relevant. just as any consumer packaged goods company might gather a focus group before developing their next toothpaste, apple gathered face data in order to develop face id. \n\n i often argue with people over whether companies like google, facebook, and apple do research. my argument is that for the most part, they do not, because they are not interested in creating new knowledge. they do not make any specific public claims or inferences about the data theyve gathered and so there isnt really anything for them to defend. they are interested in taking whatever information they collected and channeling it into products. yes, all of these companies occasionally publish a paper (i think apple has a  grand total of five ), and i would say that those papers represent real research. but i would wager that those papers represent a small fraction of the work going on in those companies. \n\n as a side note,  mark neuman  on twitter suggested that this kind of work does qualify as research for the purposes of evaluating the ethical treatment of research sbjects. i would have to agree here, and i would hope that all of these companies obtain proper informed consent from subjects before collecting their data (at least their lawyers spend a lot of time thinking about it). the fact that these companies may be collecting these data for product development and not for research doesnt absolve them of the need to treat subjects properly.", "kwds": ["on", "the", "latest", "episode", "of", " ", "not", "so", "standard", "deviations", " ",

{"feed_name": "R-bloggers", "is_blog": true, "img_loc": null, "pub_datetime": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "summary": "disclaimer: the first part of this blog post draws heavily from working with csvs on the command line, which is a beautiful resource that lists very nice tips and tricks to work with csv files before having to load them into r, or any other statistical software. i highly recommend it! also, if you find this interesting, read also data science at the command line another great resource!\nin this blog post i am going to show you how to analyze 30gb of data. 30gb of data does not qualify as big data, but its large enough that you cannot simply import it into r and start working on it, unless you have a machine with a lot of ram.\nlets start by downloading some data. i am going to import and analyze (very briefly) the airline dataset that you can download from microsoft here. i downloaded the file airontimecsv.zip from airontime87to12. once you decompress it, youll end up with 303 csv files, each around 80mb. before importing them into r, i will use command line tools to bind the rows together. but first, lets make sure that the datasets all have the same columns. i am using linux, and if you are too, or if you are using macos, you can follow along. windows users that installed the linux subsystem can also use the commands i am going to show! first, ill use the head command in bash. if youre familiar with head() from r, the head command in bash works exactly the same:\n[18-02-15 21:12] brodriguesco in /documents/airontimecsv \u27a4 head -5

do that in bash instead of r? this way, i dont need to import the data into r before checking its contents!\nit does look like the structure did not change. before importing the data into r, i am going to bind the rows of the datasets using other command line tools. again, the reason i dont import all the files into r is because i would need around 30gb of ram to do so. so its easier to do it with bash:\nhead -1 airot198710.csv __ combined.csv\nfor file in $(ls airot*); do cat $file | sed \"1 d\" ____ combined.csv; done\non the first line i use head again to only copy the column names (the first line of the first file) into a new file called combined.csv.\nthis __ operator looks like the now well known pipe operator in r, %__%, but in bash, %__% is actually |, not __. __ redirects the output of the left hand side to a file on the right hand side, not to another command. on the second line, i loop over the files. i list the files with ls, and because i want only to loop over those that are named airotxxxxx i use a regular expression, airot* to only list those. the second part is do cat $file. do is self-explanatory, and cat stands for catenate. think of it as head, but on all rows instead of just 5; it prints $file to the terminal. $file one element of the list of files i am looping over. but because i dont want to see the contents of $file on my terminal, i redirect the output with the pipe, | to another command, sed. sed has an option, \"1 d\", and what this does is filtering out the first line, containing the header, from $file before appending it with ____ to combined.csv. if you found this interesting,about it here.\nthis creates a 30gb csv file that you can then import. but how? there seems to be different ways to import and work with larger than memory data in r using your personal computer. i chose to use {sparklyr}, an r package that allows you to work with apache spark from r. apache spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing, and {sparklyr} not only offers bindings to it, but also provides a complete {dplyr} backend. lets start:\nlibrary(sparklyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nspark_dir = \"/my_2_to_disk/spark/\"\ni first load {sparklyr} and the {tidyverse} and also define a spark_dir. this is because spark creates a lot of temporary files that i want to save there instead of my root partition, which is on my ssd. my root partition only has around 20go of space left, so whenever i tried to import the data i would get the following error:\njava.io.ioexception: no space left on device\nin order to avoid this error, i define this directory on my 2to hard disk. i then define the temporary directory using the two lines below:\nconfig = spark_config()\n\nconfig$`sparklyr.shell.driver-java-options` %\n  mutate(date = ymd(paste(year, month, day_of_month, sep = \"-\")))\n\nggplot(dep_delay, aes(date, mean_delay)) + geom_smooth()\n## `geom_smooth()` using method = gam\n\nthats it for now, but in a future blog post i will continue to explore this data!\nif you found this blog post useful, you might want to follow me on twitter for blog post updates.", "kwds": ["disclaimer", "the", "first",

the random configuration          ah, its one of the first slides and i already like it !                                      here are some of the recent work by jeffrey :        a  correspondence between random neural networks and statistical field theory  by samuel s. schoenholz ,  jeffrey pennington ,  jascha sohl-dickstein      a number of recent papers have provided evidence that practical design questions about neural networks may be tackled theoretically by studying the behavior of random networks. however, until now the tools available for analyzing random neural networks have been relatively ad-hoc. in this work, we show that the distribution of pre-activations in random neural networks can be exactly mapped onto lattice models in statistical physics. we argue that several previous investigations of stochastic networks actually studied a particular factorial approximation to the full lattice model. for random linear networks and random rectified linear networks we show that the corresponding lattice models in the wide network limit may be systematically approximated by a gaussian distribution with covariance between the layers of the network. in each case, the approximate distribution can be diagonalized by fourier transformation. we show that this approximation accurately describes the results of numerical simulations of wide random neural networks. finally, we demonstrate that in each case the large scale behavior of the random networks can be approximated by an effective field theory.      nonlinear random matrix theory for deep learning by jeffrey pennington , pratik worah   neural network configurations with random weights play an important role in the analysis of deep learning. they define the initial loss landscape and are closely related to kernel and random feature methods. despite the fact that these networks are built out of random matrices, the vast and powerful machinery of random matrix theory has so far found limited success in studying them. a main obstacle in this direction is that neural networks are nonlinear, which prevents the straightforward utilization of many of the existing mathematical results. in this work, we open the door for direct applications of random matrix theory to deep learning by demonstrating that the pointwise nonlinearities typically applied in neural networks can be incorporated into a standard method of proof in random matrix theory known as the moments method. the test case for our study is the gram matrix y^ty, y=f(wx), where w is a random weight matrix, x is a random data matrix, and f is a pointwise nonlinear activation function. we derive an explicit representation for the trace of the resolvent of this matrix, which defines its limiting spectral distribution. we apply these results to the computation of the asymptotic performance of single-layer random feature methods on a memorization task and to the analysis of the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix as it propagates through a neural network. as a byproduct of our analysis, we identify an intriguing new class of activation functions with favorable properties.       geometry of neural network loss surfaces via random matrix theory by jeffrey pennington, yasaman bahri   understanding the geometry of neural network loss surfaces is important for the development of improved optimization algorithms and for building a theoretical understanding of why deep learning works. in this paper, we study the geometry in terms of the distribution of eigenvalues of the hessian matrix at critical points of varying energy. we introduce an analytical framework and a set of tools from random matrix theory that allow us to compute an approximation of this distribution under a set of simplifying assumptions. the shape of the spectrum depends strongly on the energy and another key parameter, $\\phi $, which measures the ratio of parameters to data points. our analysis predicts and numerical simulations support that for critical points of small index, the number of negative eigenvalues scales like the 3/2 power of the energy. we leave as an open problem an explanation for ur observation that, in the context of a certain memorization task, the energy of minimizers is well-approximated by the function 1/2(1\u2212\u03d5)21/2(1\u2212\u03d5)2. not strictly relatedd to random matrix theory:   deep neural networks as gaussian processes by jaehoon lee , yasaman bahri , roman novak , samuel s. schoenholz , jeffrey pennington , jascha sohl-dickstein      a deep fully-connected neural network with an i.i.d. prior over its parameters is equivalent to a gaussian process (gp) in the limit of infinite network width. this correspondence enables exact bayesian inference for neural networks on regression tasks by means of straightforward matrix computations. for single hidden-layer networks, the covariance function of this gp has long been known. recently, kernel functions for multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside of a bayesian framework. as such, previous work has not identified the correspondence between using these kernels as the covariance function for a gp and performing fully bayesian prediction with a deep neural network. in this work, we derive this correspondence and develop a computationally efficient pipeline to compute the covariance functions. we then use the resulting gp to perform bayesian inference for deep neural networks on mnist and cifar-10. we find that the gp-based predictions are competitive and can outperform neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent. we observe that the trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the corresponding gp-based computation with increasing layer width, and that the gp uncertainty is strongly correlated with prediction error. we connect our observations to the recent development of signal propagation in random neural networks. h/t  laurent

we theoretically show that one layer convolutional architectures (without a non-linearity) paired with the an energy function used in previous literature, can in fact preserve and modulate frequency coefficients in a manner so that random weights and pretrained weights will generate the same type of images. based on the results of this analysis we question whether similar properties hold in the case where one uses one convolution layer with a non-linearity. we show that in the case of relu non-linearity there are situations where only one input will give the minimum possible energy whereas in the case of no nonlinearity, there are always infinite solutions that will give the minimum possible energy. thus we can show that in certain situations adding a relu non-linearity generates less variable images.                                        join the  compressivesensing subreddit  or the  google+ community  or the  facebook page  and post there !      liked this entry ?

estimation/compressive sensing as well as to symmetric low-rank matrix factorization and tensor factorization.   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02780.pdf   _in this one, presented at allerton this year, we present a nice application of the method to the non-symmetric tensor factorization problem that was resisting until now. moreover we exploit the structure in \u00ab layers \u00bb of the model, which might be an idea of independent interest.   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.10368.pdf   _finally, our main recent result is the application of the method for proving the statistical physics conjecture for the single-letter \u00ab replica formula \u00bb for the mutual information of generalized linear models. there we also rigorously derive the inference and generalization errors of a large class of single layer neural networks such as the perceptron.   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03395.pdf   all the best        thanks jean , here are the papers you mentioned. i had mentioned  one before and i like the layer approach of the second paper !                 the stochastic interpolation method: a simple scheme to prove replica formulas in bayesian inference  by jean barbier ,  nicolas macris      in recent years important progress has been achieved towards proving the validity of the replica predictions for the (asymptotic) mutual information (or \"free energy\") in bayesian inference problems. the proof techniques that have emerged appear to be quite general, despite they have been worked out on a case-by-case basis. unfortunately, a common point between all these schemes is their relatively high level of technicality. we present a new proof scheme that is quite straightforward with respect to the previous ones. we call it the stochastic interpolation method because it can be seen as an extension of the interpolation method developped by guerra and toninelli in the context of spin glasses, with a trial \"parameter\" which becomes a stochastic process. in order to illustrate our method we show how to prove the replica formula for three non-trivial inference problems. the first one is symmetric rank-one matrix estimation (or factorisation), which is the simplest problem considered here and the one for which the method is presented in full details. then we generalize to symmetric tensor estimation and random linear estimation. in addition, we show how to prove a tight lower bound for the mutual information of non-symmetric tensor estimation. we believe that the present method has a much wider range of applicability and also sheds new insights on the reasons for the validity of replica formulas in bayesian inference.      the layered structure of tensor estimation and its mutual information  by jean barbier ,  nicolas macris ,  l\u00e9o miolane   we consider rank-one non-symmetric tensor esti- mation and derive simple formulas for the mutual information. we start by the order 2 problem, namely matrix factorization. we treat it completely in a simpler fashion than previous proofs using a new type of interpolation method developed in [1]. we then show how to harness the structure in \"layers\" of tensor estimation in order to obtain a formula for the mutual information for the order 3 problem from the knowledge of the formula for the order 2 problem, still using the same kind of interpolation. our proof technique straightforwardly general- izes and allows to rigorously obtain the mutual information at any order in a recursive way.            phase transitions, optimal errors and optimality of message-passing in generalized linear models  by jean barbier ,  florent krzakala ,  nicolas macris ,  l\u00e9o miolane ,  lenka zdeborov\u00e1   we consider generalized linear models (glms) where an unknown n-dimensional signal vector is observed through the application of a random matrix and a non-linear (possibly probabilistic) componentwise output function. we consider the models in the high-dimensional limit, where the observation consists of m points, and m/n\u2192\u03b1 where \u03b1 stays finite in the limit m,n\u2192\u221e. this situation is ubiquitous in applications ranging from supervised machine learning to signal processing. a substantial amount of theoretical work analyzed the model-case when the observation matrix has i.i.d. elements and the components of the ground-truth signal are taken independently from some known distribution. while statistical physics provided number of explicit conjectures for special cases of this model, results existing for non-linear output functions were so far non-rigorous. at the same time glms with non-linear output functions are used as a basic building block of powerful multilayer feedforward neural networks. therefore rigorously establishing the formulas conjectured for the mutual information is a key open problem that we solve in this paper. we also provide an explicit asymptotic formula for the optimal generalization error, and confirm the prediction of phase transitions in glms. analyzing the resulting formulas for several non-linear output functions, including the rectified linear unit or modulus functions, we obtain quantitative descriptions of information-theoretic limitations of high-dimensional inference. our proof technique relies on a new version of the interpolation method with an adaptive interpolation path and is of independent interest. furthermore we show that a polynomial-time algorithm referred to as generalized approximate message-passing reaches the optimal generalization error for a large set of parameters.                                         join the  compressivesensing subreddit  or the  google+ community  or the  facebook page  and post there !

( https://nuit-blanche.blogspot.de/2017/12/compressive-3d-ultrasound-imaging-using.html ) and read it with great interest. thank you very much for highlighting this important contribution! i have been working on the incorporation of cs into ultrasound imaging for several years now ( https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=x35rubaaaaaj&hl=de ) and independently discovered a very similar method for high-frame rate ultrasound imaging (ui). instead of minimizing the number of sensors, this method aims at minimizing the number of sequential pulse-echo measurements per image. it emits three types of random ultrasonic waves to reduce the coherence of the sound waves scattered by distinct basis functions, e.g. point-like scatterers or fourier basis functions. the synthesis of these waves exploits the degrees of freedom provided by modern ui systems combined with planar transducer arrays. specifically, it leverages random time delays, random apodization weights, and combinations thereof. (in essence, the method electronically realizes the fixed coding mask used by kruizinga et al. as one type of random incident ultrasonic wave.) arxiv.org provides a preprint of this work:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00205   i hope that my method appeals to you and the readers of your blog. it would also mean a lot to me, if you mentioned this work on occasion.  happy new year and keep up your good work         thank you martin ! here is the paper:          random incident sound waves for fast compressed pulse-echo ultrasound imaging  by martin f. schiffner      a novel method for the fast acquisition and the recovery of ultrasound images disrupts the tradeoff between the image acquisition rate and the image quality. it recovers the spatial compressibility fluctuations in weakly-scattering soft tissue structures from only a few sequential pulse-echo measurements of the scattered sound field. the underlying linear inverse scattering problem uses a realistic d-dimensional physical model for the pulse-echo measurement process, accounting for diffraction, the combined effects of power-law absorption and dispersion, and the specifications of a planar transducer array. postulating the existence of a nearly-sparse representation of the spatial compressibility fluctuations in a suitable orthonormal basis, the compressed sensing framework ensures its stable recovery by a sparsity-promoting \u2113q-minimization method, if the pulse-echo measurements of the individual basis functions are sufficiently incoherent. the novel method meets this condition by leveraging the degrees of freedom in the syntheses of the incident ultrasonic waves. it emits three types of random ultrasonic waves that outperform the widely-used steered quasi-plane waves (qpws). their synthesis applies random time delays, apodization weights, or combinations thereof to the voltage signals exciting the individual elements of the planar transducer array.

 quite the opposite . last year was the  best year ever  for hotel occupancy in the united states. the stock prices for the major hoteliers marriott and hilton are both up more than 40 percent in the last 12 months.  airbnb  is  a transformative travel business. but most people failed to predict the thing it would transformfor good and bad.  lets review what the market for accommodations looked like before airbnb came along. most vacation rentals were in empty second homes, often in beach, resort, and ski towns; renting them meant knowing an owner personally or working through a local agency. meanwhile, most brand-name hotels in major u.s. cities were (and still are) near business centers, where locals might work, but rarely sleep, wake, and wander around.  airbnbs great insight was to allow travelers to live as locals doin the busy downtown residential areas, near the best restaurants, bars, and other local hangouts. business travelers might prefer the location, amenities, and turndown service of a hotel. but what airbnb offered was a superior simulacra of the local experience for leisure travelersfor an affordable price, which happened to support some local dwellers income.  airbnbs business took off among a particular demographicyoung, urban, and relatively well off. half of airbnbs bookings are made by millennials, or those under 35 years old, and most of them are for leisure rather than business, according to the research firm moffettnathanson. airbnb has left an impressive mark on the way people travel to big cities: the share of american travelers using private accommodations like airbnb  quadrupled  between 2010 and 2015, according to moffettnathanson.     percentage of u.s. travelers using private accommodations      moffettnathanson    so how did all of this new business not hurt hotel bookings?  first, business travelers still prefer hotels;  more than 90 percent  of airbnbs business is in personal tourism. second, if it werent for airbnb, travelers might be suffering through a terrible squeeze in hotel space. the construction pipeline of new hotels  plunged  after the great recession. as the economy recovered and travel picked up, it seemed inevitable that the prices of scarce hotel rooms in major u.s. cities were set to jump. but they didnt. airbnb-listed rooms vastly expanded the supply of beds for travelerstourists and business travelers aliketo lie in. with the explosion of the private accommodations market, rooms opened up and hotel prices stayed  down .  so far, this sounds like a wonderful transformation: airbnb expanded the availability of beds for visitors, gave young tourists a more authentic taste of their urban destination, and kept prices down for all travelers.  but airbnbs success also encouraged dubious behavior on the part of commercial power usersproperty owners who listed downtown units (especially second residences) all year long, as if they were hotel rooms. why would would that be a problem? open apartments occupied for much of the year by airbnb-using travelers reduce the number of available homes to people who want to move into that building. high demand, plus lower supply, leads to higher prices.  several studies including research from harvard, mit, ucla, usc, and the university of massachusetts boston have come to the same conclusion : airbnb altogether drives up the price of rent in many neighborhoods. (its only fair to point out that some of the most strident conclusions came from studies  sponsored by the hotel industry .)  when i asked airbnb about these claims, a spokesperson pushed back against them in several ways, arguing that the company doesnt have a wider effect on rental prices. first, he said the vast majority of airbnbs users are merely renting out primary residences rather than filling otherwise vacant units with tourists. second, he said airbnb has worked with several cities to write rules that crack down on commercial users who try to turn their secondary residences into ersatz hotel rooms.  indeed, airbnb doesnt account for enough downtown housing to be the major driver of rising rents in major metro areas. but the basic economics is relatively straightforward. airbnb isnt just competing with hotels for travelers. it is often  competing with locals for space .   the company has shifted the burden of rising prices in crowded downtown areas from travelers to residentspushing down prices for hotel rooms, while raising rents for city dwellers. was that airbnbs intent? almost certainly not. but that is the outcome, anyway, and it is a meaningfuleven, yes,  disruptive one.  this outcome fits neither the disrupt story nor the dud story. airbnb lowered prices for tourists, supplemented the income of renters, and simply made travel to major cities more fun. but upon inspection, it shares some things in common with more-controversial companiesalbeit with less grave implications. facebook and twitter design for attention, but incidentally encourage mendacious outrage and trolling. ebay and amazon design for open marketplaces, but incidentally  encourage the frenzied resale of bulk-ordered toys  around christmas. airbnb was supposed to challenge hotels by letting tourists pay renters. but its platform is unwittingly producing a subsidy of tourists, paid for by nonparticipating urban dwellers, who bear the cost of higher rental prices. like just about every story these days about revolutionary tech platforms, airbnb is a story both of democratized access to commerce and the unintended consequences of those democratizing efforts, even when they succeed on their own terms.", "kwds": ["the", "u.s", "economy", "is", "in", "the", "midst", "of", "wrenching", "technological", "transformation", "that", "is", "fundamentally", "changing",
